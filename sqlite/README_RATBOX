This is a very hacked up version of sqlite for use with ratbox-services.
It will only build a static library, any support for running tests
is gone, as is all of the tcl stuff.  It will only install the sqlite
binary, the header files and static library wont be installed anywhere.

Most people compiling ratbox-services wont use (or notice) anything has
been removed.

The proper sqlite sources can be obtained via http://www.sqlite.org
