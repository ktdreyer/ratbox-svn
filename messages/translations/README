Translated message files (user/admin submitted)

There are user submitted message files for ircd-hybrid-7.  There is not as
of yet an easy way of creating or installing these files, but any submission
is well apreciated.

At the present time, the following languages are supported

swedish - maintained by trbz - Chris C <chris@mircscripter.com>
croation - maintained by Martin - Vid Strpic <strpic@bofhlet.net>
french - in progress
german - maintained by dmalloc - Darian Lanx <bio@gmx.net>
norwegian - in progress
macedonian - in progress
slovakian - in progress
danish - maintained by Xride - Soren Straarup Andersen <xride@eit.ihk-edu.dk>
spanish - anyone?

All of the files are installed into the prefix directory, under messages.
Each is installed into a different directory, prefixed by ircd-.

The message locale is settable at runtime with /quote SET MSGLOCALE language,
ex. /quote SET MSGLOCALE ircd-german

and via the message_locale="language"; in the general block of the ircd.conf.
ex. message_locale="ircd-german";

The ircd-hybrid team is not accountable for any mistakes, mistranslations, or
accidental insults from the use of one of the included translations.  All
translations are done by individuals who have given their time and skills to
provide localized users with prebuilt translations.  The ircd-hybrid team
will try, but cannot guarantee that the translations are up to date with the
rest of the source tree, and with the "customized" messages.

Contributions are welcome, at present time please send contributed translations
to ircd-hybrid@the-project.org, hybrid@the-project.org, or directly to one
of the people who work with the translations, currently wcampbel@botbay.net.
