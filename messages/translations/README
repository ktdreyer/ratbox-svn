Translated message files (user/admin submitted)

There are user submitted message files for ircd-hybrid-7.  There is not as
of yet an easy way of creating or installing these files, but any submission
is well apreciated.

At the present time, the following languages are supported

swedish - maintained by trbz - Chris C <chris@mircscripter.com>
croation - maintained by Martin - Vid Strpic <strpic@bofhlet.net>
french - in progress
german - maintained by dmalloc - Darian Lanx <bio@gmx.net>

Note:  the german.po is broken at the present time, do not use it
Note:  the swedish.po compiles but does not run, do not use it
