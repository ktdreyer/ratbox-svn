/*
 * - from mirc's versions.txt
 *
 *  mIRC now supports the numeric 005 tokens: CHANTYPES=# and
 *  PREFIX=(ohv)@%+ and can handle a dynamic set of channel and
 *  nick prefixes.
 *
 *  mIRC assumes that @ is supported on all networks, any mode
 *  left of @ is assumed to have at least equal power to @, and
 *  any mode right of @ has less power.
 *
 *  mIRC has internal support for @%+ modes.
 *
 *  $nick() can now handle all mode letters listed in PREFIX.
 *
 *  Also added support for CHANMODES=A,B,C,D token (not currently
 *  supported by any servers), which lists all modes supported
 *  by a channel, where:
 *
 *    A = modes that take a parameter, and add or remove nicks
 *        or addresses to a list, such as +bIe for the ban,
 *        invite, and exception lists.
 *
 *    B = modes that change channel settings, but which take
 *        a parameter when they are set and unset, such as
 *        +k key, and -k key.
 *
 *    C = modes that change channel settings, but which take
 *        a parameter only when they are set, such as +l N,
 *        and -l.
 *
 *    D = modes that change channel settings, such as +imnpst
 *        and take no parameters.
 *
 *  All unknown/unlisted modes are treated as type D.
