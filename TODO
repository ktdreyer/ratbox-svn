NOTE: If a todo matches a bug/enhancement listed on http://bugs.efnow.net
then the bug number should appear in brackets (ie (#15)) - madmax

- add example *::* and NOMATCH::* I: lines to example.conf
- add more stderr debugging (ircd -s)... one for every place we syslog()
- make wrapper function for res_init() to do spare_fd crap
- ircd -s doesn't work through a restart
- re-implement first param in m_lusers()
- trie' channel name list
- one time oper passwords

- finish RFC'ing m_message.c

----
is-'s TODO list

- umode +R for registered nick
- TBURST
- change nick instead of kill on nick collide
- PART_REASON
- dynamically extensible parser for modules
- modularize channel, network code etc (not just commands)
    we can use override_function() or similar for this
- username/passwords (iauth ?)
- channel modes to allow/prevent talking on channel
  by hostmasks. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
madmax's TODO

- Fix /links *mask* for non-opers/server_hide output (#4)
\ Make /links from file server_hide only (#6)
- Fix remote whois so 'works' but only returns idle time for opers (#1)
- Make stats p just notice opers, rather than return a list, when
  server_hide is on (#13)
- Idle time should never be sent if local whois for nonops on shide, but a 
  remote whois should show idle time, with a forced delay if local (#12)
- Split up server_hide into parts (#17)
- Client UIDs (ts4 style?) for cookies (later for persistent nicks)
- vchans_oper_only (#18)
- Definable server region or 'global' (open I) for /links output (#20)

Adrian's TODO list

* Check to make sure a SIGHUP actually causes a rehash. The last time I tried
  it, the server stayed running, but the ircd stopped listening on ports.

* make the reserved FD limit run-time tunable, esp from comm_open()
  This involves making fd_table[] a dynamically growing/(don't bother with
  shrinking) list.. have the max fd list configurable in the conf file..

* Fix the anti-client flood code to not be so anal when people connect -
  I've counted all lines from a client as being a flood, so if a client
  connects and issues JOIN's to a whole bunch of channels the flood
  protection stops everything coming through at once .. (not that I mind.. :)

* PLEASE redo all dlink_list management with the stuff in src/tools.c

* In the server outbound connection code, make the sendto_realops()
  logging more sane. Ie, if there's an error, also log the errno string.

* look at the old Listener code in s_bsd.c before I chopped it. Notice
  the anti-flood code in there. Make sure the same load-checking stuff
  is in listener.c

* look at mo_die() - find the restart function, break out the shutdown code,
  and tidy shit up!

* get send_message(), replace comm_setselect() with send_queued_write(), see
  if the optimization works

* search for FLAGS_DEADSOCKET and IsDead() tests, figure out how to get
  rid of them. Remember that you can't just call exit_client() from
  dead_link() as I *bet* that cptr going away would be *bad*. So, this
  basically means going through the code and checking return values of
  things. :-)

* remove aconf->ipnum, since we're doing a DNS lookup each time we
  connect. If people don't like this, they can (should!) be running
  a name cache locally!

db-->>ummm aconf->ipnum is used for IP based klines only, not for DNS

* What the _FUCK_ is IsLocal() and FLAGS_LOCAL and why the *smeg* is it
  not defined ?

* find what causes this

[cacheboy]  Link with irc.vchan[unknown@255.255.255.255] established: (TS )
            link

thats INADDR_NONE. Find, fix.

* Add the IRCnet(?) split logic for nick collisions - on a nick collision,
  change to "%d-%s", random, nick

* Hrm. Since Diane changed the user->channel code to use dlink_lists,
  she's made some things faster (deopping lists of people in a net.join,
  finding an op, etc) but some things slower (deleting from the channel,
  change_channel_membership(), etc.) What needs to happen is that for
  each channel a user is on, a flag needs to be set tracking which list
  they're on so we don't have to search the lists when we want to change
  their status. This could become a slow-CPU sticking point.

db-->> Actually, the old code was just as slow at doing that, since
    it was a link list of SLink's with a flag denoting whether client
    on channel was an op or not... With a channel of 100 clients and 
    thats 100 link SLink's

* Look at removing the whole DNS ref_count evilness now that the cache
  has gone away. We should be *copying* the returned result, not just
  storing a pointer to it. This will make a lot of the code much simpler.
  (Hopefully.)

Done things:

* in read_packet(), there is a bit where a rejected client is being
  "fake" read. Make sure you read() all the data first, or we'll end up
  CPU-hogging the box. (check REJECT_HOLD)

* kill fdlist_add() and associated mask stuff. We'll revisit the fdset
  stuff through comm_setselect() magic later.

* Find what uses the res.c routines. Since there's no caching anymore,
  rip out the code that deals with cached replies.

* KILL THE ZIPLINKS CODE! DIE! Reimplement as an external process later.

* make sure we've fd_note()d on all the fd's as they change state
  eg a listen socket becoming a client or server, etc ...

* check out what the hell safe_write() is, why its in s_conf.c but being
  used in other places, and why its closing the fd for people. It should
  be moved out of there, and *not* close fds (forcing its users to instead!)
  (Its been deleted now.. thanks Dianora)

* ok, this sucks. search for cptr->since, and esp in src/parse.c .
  All this flood protection has to come out and reappear in *one* place!
  (Adrian rewrote the line buffering code and client flood code..)

* look at timeout_resolver() and the actual work function, remove needing
  to track the time for the next DNS timeout, see if we can make them
  simpler.
    -- Nah, don't worry about this one. leave the DNS resolver alone..


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Little things to be done given enough time and initiative -Hwy

.  Bring back CIDR support in operator blocks
   user="wcampbel@144.26.*"; # works - even if the hostname resolves
   user="wcampbel@144.26.0.0/16"; # Does not work
.  The 3 logging path settings are NOOP in the conf (logpath, oper_log, 
   gline_log)
.  $$*.server.mask and $#*.user.mask do not currently work...
   Notice -- Unknown prefix (:Hwy-7!wcampbel@bee-90-245.bee.net PRIVMSG 
   $hyb-devel.monkie.org :test) from 
   hyb-devel.monkie.org[wcampbel@cats.meow.st], Squitting 
   Hwy-7!wcampbel@bee-90-245.bee.net (DONE -- except for LL bugs)
.  Have a few more things /quote SET'table
.  More documentation on the gettext stuff, enough for a layman to use
.  Extra \r\n sent to the log file by ts_warn needs to go
.  Fix tools/fixklines.c and tools/klineParse.c for the new kline.conf
   format.
.  Update tools/mkconf as well.
.  Document the OpenSSL CHALLENGE support more.
.  Create some make release or something for rsa_respond
.  Fix convertconf more
.  Do we still need start_ircd.c and ircd_start.c?
.  Look to see what other STATS commands can be made optionally oper-only
.  2 pass conf parser (grab classes before anything that uses them)
.  Use scrypt or just plain 'crypt' libs on FreeBSD, we support both types
   of passwords without any effort currently, why should we restrict ourselves
   on some systems?
.  m_map.so in contrib
.  m_mkpasswd.so in contrib
.  Do we still need ircd_start.c and start_ircd.c?
.  Re-add the ability to set usermodes from the conf (oldconf field after the
   O: line class)
.  What does the name field in the listen block do?  (oldconf P:name:ip::port)
   (Nothing now, it's GONE)
.  Get rid of the %lu format in m_eob.c, go back to a damn %d
.  Fix the format of TIME, we used to use %t in date()...that seems to be
   gone now.... Saturday January 20 2001 -- 15:49: 3 - 5: 0
   That looks like shit...fix it
.  Randomize the order of WHO #channel and NAMES #channel in +a mode.
.  Add in exemptions to D lines into the conf (old d: lines)
.  The syntax error in conf line number is 1 less than it actually is.
   Notice -- 77: syntax error on line:         e_lines_oper_only=yes;
   When e_lines_oper_only=yes; is on line 78. (fixed...)
.  <Riedel> walter : have you implemented the motd= thing in the auth block ?
.  <mopi> still haven't made default chan flags configurable, eh? :/
.  Finish the OpenSSL challenge/rsa_response stuff
.  Fix topic bursting to LL servers (broke lately for some reason)
.  Other places that the number formats were replaced with that damn %lu

-- Rodder's list
.  Add scalable database-based authentication.  Probably part of Iauth.
   Also add support for server-side notify with the list stored in the
   auth database.  This would make ircd an awesome instant messaging
   back-end.


-- Diane's list

* (Isomer promised this)
  break /accept link when target changes nick (I can do that instead if
  need be ) (DONE, Diane did this)

* add logging to ircd.log of possible channel floods

* add code to log a minute worth of flooding if the ircd gets n possible
  flood messages on a channel in t seconds.. This log would be available
  to hand to authorities if requested.

* Need to fix server masking for incoming connectings
  Cleanest would be to have an optional 'hostmask="";'
  in the connect block, instead of the port number meaning number
  of bits to the left of the '.' to chop off. Thats dumb.
  i.e. from the original example.conf
  # For example, to make hayes.ims.alaska.edu present itself to the world as
  # *.alaska.edu, I would use a 2 (to strip off the first two parts).  If you

  We'd have hostmask="*.alaska.edu";
