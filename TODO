Adrian's TODO list

* MAKE SURE DIANE KILLS THE REFCOUNT IN THE DLINK CODE!!!!

* PLEASE redo all dlink_list management with the stuff in src/tools.c

* In the server outbound connection code, make the sendto_realops()
  logging more sane. Ie, if there's an error, also log the errno string.

* check out what the hell safe_write() is, why its in s_conf.c but being
  used in other places, and why its closing the fd for people. It should
  be moved out of there, and *not* close fds (forcing its users to instead!)

* look at timeout_resolver() and the actual work function, remove needing
  to track the time for the next dns timeout, see if we can make them
  simpler.
    -- Nah, don't worry about this one. leave the DNS resolver alone..

* look at the old Listener code in s_bsd.c before I chopped it. Notice
  the anti-flood code in there. Make sure the same load-checking stuff
  is in listener.c

* look at mo_die() - find the restart function, break out the shutdown code,
  and tidy shit up!

* get send_message(), replace comm_setselect() with send_queued_write(), see
  if the optimisation works

* search for FLAGS_DEADSOCKET and IsDead() tests, figure out how to get
  rid of them. Remember that you can't just call exit_client() from
  dead_link() as I *bet* that cptr going away would be *bad*. So, this
  basically means going through the code and checking return values of
  things. :-)

* remove aconf->ipnum, since we're doing a DNS lookup each time we
  connect. If people don't like this, they can (should!) be running
  a namecache locally!

* make the reserved FD limit run-time tuneable, esp from comm_open()

* What the _FUCK_ is IsLocal() and FLAGS_LOCAL and why the *smeg* is it
  not defined ?

* find what causes this

[cacheboy]  Link with irc.vchan[unknown@255.255.255.255] established: (TS )
            link

thats INADDR_NONE. Find, fix.

* Add the ircnet(?) split logic for nick collisions - on a nick collision,
  change to "%d-%s", random, nick

* ok, this sucks. search for cptr->since, and esp in src/parse.c .
  All this flood protection has to come out and reappear in *one* place!


Done things:

* in read_packet(), there is a bit where a rejected client is being
  "fake" read. Make sure you read() all the data first, or we'll end up
  CPU-hogging the box. (check REJECT_HOLD)

* kill fdlist_add() and associated mask stuff. We'll revisit the fdset
  stuff through comm_setselect() magic later.

* Find what uses the res.c routines. Since there's no caching anymore,
  rip out the code that deals with cached replies.

* KILL THE ZIPLINKS CODE! DIE! Reimplement as an external process later.

* make sure we've fd_note()d on all the fd's as they change state
  eg a listen socket becoming a client or server, etc ...
