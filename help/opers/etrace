ETRACE [-full|-v4|-v6]

With no argument, ETRACE gives a list of all clients connected
to the local server, both users and operators.

With -full option, ETRACE lists all clients along with the
two unused fields sent in the USER command when they connected.

When ipv6 is enabled, the -v4 and -v6 options display clients
using ipv4 and ipv6 respectively.
