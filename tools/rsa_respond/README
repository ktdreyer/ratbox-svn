genkey:

genkey creates the private and public key pairs used in Hybrid's CHALLENGE
oper system.

Syntax:
$ ./genkey <public key> <private key>

Keep the private key safe with a copy of the respond program.
Distribute the private key to the admin(s) of the server(s) you oper on.

respond:

respond takes the challenge from the server and creates a valid response
to pass back to the server.

Syntax:
$ ./respond <private key> <challenge>

Notes:

The private key file is protected by a passphrase, entered when the key is
created.  The passphrase is prompted for whenever respond is called.
