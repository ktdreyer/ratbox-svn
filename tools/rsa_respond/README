rsa_respond
(a tiny little example implimentation of client support for RSA authentication)

This program takes the hexidecimal challenge string from the irc server and
produces the appropriate response (as calculated against your ssh identity file
or by ssh-agent)

An example usage (tested on BitchX):

/on ^386 * exec rsa_respond a $1

Will cause the response to be displayed on numeric 386 received from the IRC
server (numeric 386 is in reply to /quote CHALLENGE).  The response is
generated using a key in the ssh-agent.

Unfortunately, we can't make it respond with a /oper command or anything else.
/exec output can only be directed to the console, or a PRIVMSG/NOTICE afaik :(
