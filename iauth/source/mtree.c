/*
 *  This file contains routines to add and locate items
 * in a "modified" tree. These routines were specifically
 * designed for I: and K: line handling. In short, a
 * rather complicated solution is needed to solve a seemingly
 * trivial problem.
 *
 * The problem is this: Suppose you have 2 I: lines:
 *
 * I:NOMATCH::*@*::1
 * I:NOMATCH::*@*.varner.com::1
 *
 *  Now, if you place the *@* in front of the *@*.varner.com
 * I: line, it could be put in from of *@*.varner.com in
 * the I: line linked list. Now suppose a client connects
 * from koruna.varner.com. If you do a simple linear search
 * of the linked list, you will come across the *@* I: line
 * first, and it happens to be a good match - but it is not
 * the BEST match.
 *  A widely used feature of I: lines is so you can group
 * all the generic users under a common I: line, such as *@*
 * or *@*.com, but make separate I: lines for server operators
 * or administrators (that may conflict with the generic I: lines).
 *
 *  This is where the modified tree comes in. As I: and K: lines
 * are read in, they are added to a regular linked list, and also
 * a type of tree. In this special tree, each node contains
 * part of a hostname - specifically the part between dots.
 *
 *  So, if you make an I: line for *.koruna.varner.com, it would
 * be entered into the tree in the following manner:
 *
 *                       com
 *                        |
 *                      varner
 *                        |
 *                      koruna
 *                        |
 *                        *
 *
 *  This is convenient because when a client connects from
 * *.koruna.varner.com, you can take apart their hostname in
 * the same manner and compare each segment to it's corresponding
 * node in the tree.
 *
 *  Now suppose you wanted to add another I: line for
 * hyland.magenet.com.
 *
 *  The new tree would then look like this:
 *
 *                       com
 *                       /
 *                     /
 *                   /
 *                varner --> magenet
 *                  |           |
 *                koruna      hyland
 *                  |
 *                  *
 *
 *  Notice the TLD is always kept on top. If you wanted to add
 * a new TLD, for example: *.underworld.n?t, the tree
 * would look like this:
 *
 *                       com ---> n?t
 *                      /            \
 *                    /                \
 *                  /                    \
 *               varner -> magenet   underworld
 *                 |          |           |
 *               koruna     hyland        *
 *                 |
 *                 *
 *
 * and so on..
 *  The easy part is setting up the tree. The hard part is
 * making a search algorithm to handle every possibility.
 * I've designed the following search algorithm (SearchSubTree()).
 * When an ircd server requests an authorization, iauth takes
 * the client's hostname (uwns.underworld.net) and breaks it up
 * into segments, keeping pointers to each segment. In this
 * case, the array would look like this:
 *
 *   array[0] = "uwns"
 *   array[1] = "underworld"
 *   array[2] = "net"
 *
 *  Then it begins with the last segment (net) and searches the
 * very top level of the tree. First it searches for an exact
 * match, and if it finds none, it searches for a wildcard
 * match. The reason it takes exact matches over wildcard
 * matches, is because each level is searched only once. If it
 * took the first wildcard match it came to, there might be
 * a better (exact) match later down the line. And again, that
 * is the entire reason a tree is needed - because more exact
 * matches are better than generic matches.
 *  In this case, there is no exact match for the TLD, so it
 * takes the next best thing (n?t). It then hops down a level,
 * and searches for the next lower index of our array (underworld).
 * It will find an exact match right away and jump down to the next
 * (and final) level. It will again find an acceptable wildcard
 * match on the final level, and since there are no more pieces
 * to our hostname, declare that the client has an acceptable I:
 * line.
 *
 *  One more note about wildcard matches. The tree search starts
 * with the last segment of the hostname. In other words, if
 * you have two I: lines:
 *   1) *@*.net
 *   2) *@uwns.*
 * A client from uwns.underworld.net will be given the first I:
 * line. This is not a bug ;-). It is the way the routine was
 * designed. If you were to do something like this:
 *   1) *@*.net
 *   2) *@uwns.*.net
 * then the client would be sure to get the second I: line.
