The hybrid team is a group of ircd coders who were frustrated
with the instability and all-out "dirtiness" of the EFnet ircd's
available. "hybrid" is the name for the collective efforts of a group
of people, all of us.
 
Anyone is welcome to contribute to this effort.  You are encouraged
to participate in the Hybrid mailing list.  To subscribe to the
