The hybrid team is a group of ircd coders who were frustrated
with the instability and all-out "dirtiness" of the EFnet ircd's
available. "hybrid" is the name for the collective efforts of a group
of people, all of us.
 
Anyone is welcome to contribute to this effort.  You are encouraged
to participate in the Hybrid mailing list.  To subscribe to the
Hybrid List, send email to listmanager@the-project.org with the
