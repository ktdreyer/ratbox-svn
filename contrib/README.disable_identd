This diff adds a config option to the general {} block called disable_auth
to hybrid 7.  To disable identd requests add something like this to your
config file:

general {
	disable_auth = yes;
}

You should note that this does not effect other identd related settings with
regard to stripping tildes or the requirement of identd checking in auth {}
blocks.
