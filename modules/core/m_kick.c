       *     2) The channel is desynced. That can STILL happen with TS
       *        
       *     Now, the old code roger wrote, would allow the KICK to 
       *     go through. Thats quite legit, but lets weird things like
       *     KICKS by users who appear not to be chanopped happen,
       *     or even neater, they appear not to be on the channel.
       *     This fits every definition of a desync, doesn't it? ;-)
       *     So I will allow the KICK, otherwise, things are MUCH worse.
       *     But I will warn it as a possible desync.
