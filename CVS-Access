The ircd-ratbox CVS repository is available for anonymous access.

One can checkout the tree as follows:

cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.ratbox.org:/cvsroot login

Type enter when prompted for a password.

From there you can checkout the stable tree as follows:

cvs -z3 -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.ratbox.org:/cvsroot co -r RATBOX_1 ircd-ratbox

Or if you prefer the bleeding edge stuff:

cvs -z3 -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.ratbox.org:/cvsroot co ircd-ratbox

Of course at any given time the CVS tree could be broken.  If you are
planning on using the CVS tree you very well may want to be on the mailing
list, you can subscribe at:
