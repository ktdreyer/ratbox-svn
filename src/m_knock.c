 * m_functions execute protocol messages on this server:
 *
 *      cptr    is always NON-NULL, pointing to a *LOCAL* client
 *              structure (with an open socket connected!). This
 *              identifies the physical socket where the message
 *              originated (or which caused the m_function to be
 *              executed--some m_functions may call others...).
 *
 *      sptr    is the source of the message, defined by the
 *              prefix part of the message if present. If not
 *              or prefix not found, then sptr==cptr.
 *
 *              (!IsServer(cptr)) => (cptr == sptr), because
 *              prefixes are taken *only* from servers...
 *
 *              (IsServer(cptr))
 *                      (sptr == cptr) => the message didn't
 *                      have the prefix.
 *
 *                      (sptr != cptr && IsServer(sptr) means
 *                      the prefix specified servername. (?)
 *
 *                      (sptr != cptr && !IsServer(sptr) means
 *                      that message originated from a remote
 *                      user (not local).
 *
 *              combining
 *
 *              (!IsServer(sptr)) means that, sptr can safely
 *              taken as defining the target structure of the
 *              message in this server.
 *
 *      *Always* true (if 'parse' and others are working correct):
 *
 *      1)      sptr->from == cptr  (note: cptr->from == cptr)
 *
 *      2)      MyConnect(sptr) <=> sptr == cptr (e.g. sptr
 *              *cannot* be a local connection, unless it's
 *              actually cptr!). [MyConnect(x) should probably
 *              be defined as (x == x->from) --msa ]
 *
 *      parc    number of variable parameter strings (if zero,
 *              parv is allowed to be NULL)
 *
 *      parv    a NULL terminated list of parameter pointers,
 *
 *                      parv[0], sender (prefix string), if not present
 *                              this points to an empty string.
 *                      parv[1]...parv[parc-1]
 *                              pointers to additional parameters
 *                      parv[parc] == NULL, *always*
 *
 *              note:   it is guaranteed that parv[0]..parv[parc-1] are all
 *                      non-NULL pointers.
