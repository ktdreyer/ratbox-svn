/*
 * How its used:
 *
 * Should be pretty self-explanatory. Events are one-shot, so once your
 * callback is called, you have to re-add the event through eventAdd().
 * Note that the event text is used by last_event_ran to point to the
 * last event run, so you should make sure its a static string. (Don't
 * ask me why, its how it is in the squid code..)
