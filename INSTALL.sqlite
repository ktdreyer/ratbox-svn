sqlite3 database backend
------------------------

PREFIX here is the path of the prefix to which ratbox-services installed to.
SOURCE here is the path to the ratbox-services directory it was compiled from.

If ratbox-services compiled sqlite itself, the sqlite3 binary can be
found in PREFIX/bin.

To initialise the database:
	sqlite3 PREFIX/etc/ratbox-services.db < SOURCE/doc/schema-sqlite.txt
