ratbox-services upgrade guide
-----------------------------

If you are upgrading between major version numbers (eg, 1.0.x -> 1.1.x), you
should read doc/whats-new-VER.txt.  This file will document the major
changes between the versions.

When upgrading between versions, you should run the dbupgrade.pl script
found in tools/.  This script will output the list of database changes
since a given version, for a given database schema.

Your database should only be upgraded after you have terminated the old
version, but before you have started the new version.

This upgrade script only accounts for released versions, not for subversion
copies.

You should always run the upgrade script with your full version -- keeping
any "beta", "rc" tags etc.

The script is run as:
	./dbupgrade.pl <version> <schema>
Eg,
	./dbupgrade.pl 1.0.3 sqlite


If you are upgrading from the 1.0.x series, it is important to note the
database backend (sqlite2) is no longer supported.  SQLite is still
supported, but only sqlite3, which is incompatible with sqlite2.

To upgrade from 1.0.x, you should extract your data from the database,
install it into the new database and run the dbupgrade.pl script after this
has been done.

You can extract a complete dump of data in sqlite2 via:	
	sqlite etc/ratbox-services.db ".dump" > db-dump.txt

You should then follow the instructions in INSTALL.<db-backend>, using this
database dump instead of the given schema.
