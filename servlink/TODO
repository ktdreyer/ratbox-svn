Servlink todo list
------------------

Deal with avail_out = 0, then reduce the size of the buffer.
	We won't usually hit 6x compression, but I just went over that..
	We should deal gracefully with running out of output space...

Implement read handler for control fd in hybrid.
	This would allow commands like CMD_ZIPLINK_STATS to check
	performance of the ziplink code, which could then send
	RPL_ZIPLINK_STATS,0,4,out data,out wire,in wire,in data
	back to the ircd.
