This is the current beta version of ratbox-services.

-- ratbox-services-1.0beta3
- reorganised the directory structure

  IMPORTANT: You must move your configuration files for them to work
  with the new directory structure.  After installing this version,
  you should move your config file and db file to:
  	PREFIX/etc/ratbox-services.conf
	PREFIX/etc/ratbox-services.db

- services privs are now far more fine grained

  IMPORTANT: If you expect to have any admin access to your services,
  you must redo your privs per operator {};.  See example.conf for
  details.

- added CHANSERV::SET::NOVOICECMD, disables use of VOICE command in channel
- fix a core when exiting dcc clients due to read/write error
- added NICKSERV::SET::WARN, controls whether warnings are issued when
  another client uses a registered nickname, can be disabled in the config
  via allow_set_warn = yes|no;
- make USERSERV::USERINFO return email address
- fix checks for socket() and gethostbyname()
- NICKSERV::REGAIN renamed to NICKSERV::RELEASE, added NICKSERV::REGAIN
  which when used by clients on servers supporting it, forcibly changes
  their nickname to the one they wish to regain
- allow autoop/autovoice setting in CHANSERV::ADDUSER
- tidy up tsinfo updates
- add CHANSERV::CHANLIST and USERSERV::USERLIST, to list registered
  channels/usernames
- added a shortcut generator for use with ircd, this creates an ircd
  module containing commands such as /chanserv to interface with services
- can now forcibly build the bundled sqlite with --with-sqlitebuild to
  configure
- add short introductions to the help indexes
- .rehash help/kill -USR1 now reloads helpfiles


-- ratbox-services-1.0beta2
- added nickname services which work via username registrations.

  IMPORTANT: if nickserv is not disabled in configure via --disable-nickserv
  you MUST update your services database with the new nickserv table.

  Once it has been installed, edit the schema.txt file, removing the other
  CREATE TABLE commands, apart from the CREATE TABLE nicks command.  Then
  run: sqlite services.sb < schema.txt
