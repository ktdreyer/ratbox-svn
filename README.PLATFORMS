IRCD-Hybrid Platforms Information

Sometimes problems and inconsistencies in the Hybrid code may only occur 
on a specific platform (architecture and/or operating system and/or 
compiler). In these cases you may want to directly contact a person who is 
interested in maintaining Hybrid on that platform. Below is a list of 
people who have jumped up and taken responsibility for Hybrid, including 
making sure it compiles, runs, and doesn't crash.
