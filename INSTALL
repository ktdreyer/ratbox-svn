ratbox-services installation guide
----------------------------------

1. Decide which services you dont want compiled in.  By default all 
   will be compiled in, as they can be disabled in the config file.

2. Run the configure script.  By default it will attempt to install to
   /usr/local/ratbox-services.  If you want it in this directory, then
   as root you must first:
   	mkdir /usr/local/ratbox-services
	chown youruser:yourgroup /usr/local/ratbox-services
   Then install as normal from your username.

   If you wish to install it to a different directory include the 
   --prefix option:
   	./configure --prefix=/home/user/services

   If there are services you dont want compiled in, like the operbot:
   	./configure --prefix=/home/user/services --disable-operbot

   See ./configure --help for more information.

3. Run make

4. Run make install

5. Change to the directory it installed to, edit example.conf and save it
   as services.conf.

6. Run ./ratbox-services
