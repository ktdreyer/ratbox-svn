ratbox-services installation guide
----------------------------------

1. Decide which services you dont want compiled in.  By default all 
   will be compiled in, as they can be disabled in the config file.
   These can be listed via ./configure --help

2. Ensure you have a grammar/lexical parser installed.  Bison and flex are
   recommended, though yacc and lex should do.

3. ratbox-services will automatically compile sqlite if it is not found, 
   which is used for storing the database.  
   
   You may prefer to have sqlite installed system wide.  If that is the case, 
   you should download sqlite version 2.x from 
   http://www.sqlite.org/download.html and install it yourself.
   
   The sqlite included here is NOT suitable for installation system wide, 
   only for building ratbox-services.  See sqlite/README_RATBOX

   Note, SQLite is simply a database interface to a normal file, it does
   not run as a seperate process.

4. Run the configure script.  By default it will attempt to install to
   /usr/local/ratbox-services.  If you want it in this directory, then
   as root you must first:
   	mkdir /usr/local/ratbox-services
	chown youruser:yourgroup /usr/local/ratbox-services
   Then install as normal from your username.  Services will not run as
   root, nor should you run make install as root.


   If you wish to install it to a different directory include the 
   --prefix option:
   	./configure --prefix=/home/user/services

   If there are services you dont want compiled in, like the operbot,
   include the relevant option:
   	./configure --disable-operbot

   If SQLite is installed but configure doesnt find it, and you do not
   wish ratbox-services to build sqlite itself:
        ./configure --with-sqlite=PATH
   configure will search PATH/include and PATH/lib for the needed SQLite
   parts.

   If your nick or topic length set in ircd are different to 9 and 160
   respectively, then:
   	./configure --with-nicklen=LENGTH
	./configure --with-topiclen=LENGTH
   where LENGTH is a number.

   See ./configure --help for more information.  Naturally, options should
   be combined so ./configure is only run once.

5. Run make

6. Run make install

7. Change to the directory it installed to.

8. Edit example.conf and save it as ratbox-services.conf.

9. Initialise your database, this must be done even if you are converting
   from hybserv:
	sqlite ratbox-services.db < schema.txt

   If ratbox-services compiled sqlite itself, the sqlite binary can be
   found in PREFIX/bin.

   If you are converting from hybserv, see the website for further
   instructions: http://services.ircd-ratbox.org/

10. Run ./ratbox-services

11. Investigate PREFIX/bin/ircd-shortcut.pl if you wish to install command
    shortcuts for your services in your ircd, eg /chanserv etc.
