HOW TO BUILD:
-------------
As of hybrid-4, the distribution uses gnu autoconf instead of the old
Config script.  The Makefile has also been updated to include CFLAGS
defines for popular modern OSes.

0.  Read the ChangeLog file to find out about the exciting new
features in this version.

1.  Run the configure script.  It will create include/setup.h and the
Makefiles to match your system.  In hybrid-7, the paths are now handled
with the --prefix option to configure, not in config.h.  /usr/local/ircd
is the default if no prefix is specified.
	./configure --prefix="/usr/local/ircd"

2.  Look over the "include/config.h" file.  This allows you to change
the remaining hard coded options of how the ircd will operate.  Most 
admins will only have to change a few settings.  "HARD_FDLIMIT_" and
"INIT_MAXCLIENTS" are two that must be changed to the proper values for 
your operating system.  Note that these two settings must be <= FD_SETSIZE 
(usually defined in the system includes, but may need to overridden in 
the Makefile).  If you desire userlog and operlog functionality, then you 
will have to adjust the FNAME_USERLOG and FNAME_OPERLOG defines, as they 
are not tied to the prefix.  USE_SYSLOG is the final one that most admins
will need to edit.  Note that you must have permission by the sysadmin 
to send messages to the system log files.  All other settings in config.h
are not necessary to adjust.

3.  "make" should build ircd.

4.  "make install" to install the server, modules, and tools in the path 
defined in config.h and the prefix specified when configure was run.


HOW TO GET HELP:
----------------
Send Check or Money Order to...  just kidding!  You're on your own for
support.  Try asking other ircd-hybrid admins on EFnet if you can't fix
it yourself.  If you do fix anything, however, please send context
diffs to ircd-hybrid@the-project.org so the fixes can be incorporated
into the next release of ircd-hybrid.  If hybrid crashes on you,
PLEASE CONTACT ircd-hybrid@the-project.org ASAP with a backtrace of
the core.  The hybrid team can't fix bugs if no one tells us about them!

There is now a mailing list for general discussion of Hybrid.  To subscribe
to the Hybrid List, send email to listmanager@the-project.org with
the subject "subscribe hybrid".

NOTES:
------
The best way to get a backtrace of the core is to follow this sequence of 
instructions:
1.  Change to the directory where the core file is
2.  Run gdb on the binary and the core file.  With an unmodified Hybrid-7, 
an example command line is below (in the /usr/local/ircd directory)
$ gdb bin/ircd ircd.core
3.  At the "(gdb)" prompt, enter the command "bt"
4.  Save the output of the backtrace command and send it to 
ircd-hybrid@the-project.org.
5.  Be sure to save the ircd binary, the modules, and the core file in a 
safe place in case the developers need to look deeper than a backtrace 
provides.
