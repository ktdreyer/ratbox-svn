Last tested version: ircd-ratbox 2.0beta2

To compile ircd on VMS, simply execute the make.com script
from the top-level ircd directory:

  $ SET DEF [.IRCD-RATBOX]
  $ @MAKE

This should build [.SRC]IRCD.EXE and the releated tools.

You may want to edit [.INCLUDE]CONFIG.H, but there is no longer
anything very interesting there.

IRCD needs the following logical names defined: IRCD$BASEDIR, IRCD$CONFDIR,
IRCD$BINDIR, and IRCD$LOGDIR.
For example:

$ ASSIGN DISK$USER:[EBROCKLESBY.IRCD.BIN] IRCD$BASEDIR:
$ ASSIGN DISK$USER:[EBROCKLESBY.IRCD.BIN.BIN] IRCD$BINDIR:
$ ASSIGN DISK$USER:[EBROCKLESBY.IRCD.BIN.ETC] IRCD$CONFDIR:
$ ASSIGN DISK$USER:[EBROCKLESBY.IRCD.BIN.LOG] IRCD$LOGDIR:

After IRCD.EXE is built, you'll have to install it by hand. Create
the above directories, and put IRCD.EXE into IRCD$BINDIR:.  The sample
[.doc]example.conf should be modified as needed and placed in
IRCD$CONFDIR:IRCD.CONF. 

Known problems on VMS:
  - Lack of SERVLINK support means that ZIP and SSL aren't yet possible
    for VMS.
  - If IRCD.EXE exits immediately after startup, make sure that IRCD$CONFDIR:IRCD.PID
    doesn't exist.

It should work fine when started with RUN/DETACH.

So far, IRCD has been tested on OpenVMS 7.2/Alpha using DEC C V6.0-001.

If anyone gets ircd working on VMS (or has problems with it), please mail me
(ejb@sdf.lonestar.org) with any comments you have.

If you have problem compiling from source, or are on a slow system
(building IRCD on a VAXstation 3000 takes about two hours),
binary distributions are available on the FTP site.
(actually, they aren't yet, but at some time in the future they should be)
