(NOTE: ircd doesn't currently build on VMS, a few things are left
to be done. However, if it did work, this is how you'd do it..)

To compile ircd, execute the following commands (this assumes
you extracted the archive into [.ircd-hybrid-7]:

$ SET DEF [.IRCD-HYBRID-7]D-HYBRID-7.INCLUDE]
$ COPY SETUP.H_VMS SETUP>H
$ EDIT CONFIG.H   <or whatever your preferred editor is>
Change config.h as appropriate.  Note that the paths have to
be changed to use VMS-style pathnames, not Unix style.
$ SET DEF [-]
$ @make

This should build [.src]ircd.exe, and the associated modules
[.modules]*.obj;*. It's not installed automatically yet, you'll
have to copy it to IRCD_PREFIX by hand.
