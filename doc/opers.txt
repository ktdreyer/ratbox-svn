		  The [port] must be specified with [server_B], this is	
		  usually 6667.

                  the server you are on if no [server|nick] is given.

                  All users that use TRACE can see the path to

                  connected, as well as the connection class they
                  fall into.

                  Opers can see all clients connected to a server
