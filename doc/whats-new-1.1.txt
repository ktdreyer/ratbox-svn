Database
--------
- Make the code database agnostic so that it does not care about which
  database is used as the backend.
- Add support for mysql: --enable-mysql=[PATH]
- Add support for sqlite3 (default)
- Remove support for sqlite2
- Support for database hooks, so external processes can trigger updates done
  on the information kept in RAM.  See doc/dbhook.txt

Compilation
-----------
- New configure option, --with-userreglen=LENGTH, to configure the maximum
  length of a registered username.

Services
--------
- GLOBAL service now supports welcome messages, sent when a user connects to
  irc.
- userserv::resetpass added, to email users a confirmation for a password
  reset.
- userserv::register can now email users an activation token to confirm
  registration before the username can be used
- banserv now accepts time modifiers w/d/h for weeks, days and hours.  These
  may not be combined -- so "1w" is valid, "1w1d" is not.

Config file
-----------
- New service {}; flag, 'require_shortcut', which requires commands to this
  service are done through command shortcuts rather than msg.
- New database {}; section, controlling options for databases.
- New email {}; section, controls options for sending emails.
- New userserv option, resetpass_duration = <time>; controls how long
  userserv::resetpass requests are kept around.
