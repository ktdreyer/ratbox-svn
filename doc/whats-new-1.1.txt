Database
--------
- Make the code database agnostic so that it does not care about which
  database is used as the backend.
- Add support for mysql: --enable-mysql=[PATH]
- Add support for sqlite3 (default)
- Remove support for sqlite2
- Support for database hooks, so external processes can trigger updates done
  on the information kept in RAM.  See doc/dbhook.txt

General
-------
- TS6 support
- Make stats o/O return a list of opers with access, can only be issued by
  ircops and services opers
- .flags command has gone, it has been replaced with .chat [on|off] and the
  watchserv system

Compilation
-----------
- New configure option, --with-userreglen=LENGTH, to configure the maximum
  length of a registered username.

Userserv
--------
- userserv::resetpass added, to email users a confirmation for a password
  reset.
- userserv::register can now email users an activation token to confirm
  registration before the username can be used
- userserv::usersuspend now takes a required suspend reason

Chanserv
--------
- chanserv::suspend now takes a required suspend reason

Operserv
--------
- operserv::rehash added, to rehash services
- operserv::dbsync added, to force a database sync (primarily of the last
  time a username/channel was used)
- operserv::die added, to terminate services.
- operserv::listopers added, to list connected services opers

Banserv
-------
- banserv now accepts time modifiers w/d/h for weeks, days and hours.  These
  may not be combined -- so "1w" is valid, "1w1d" is not.

Global Service
--------------
- GLOBAL now supports welcome messages, sent when a user connects to
  irc.

Watchserv
---------
- A new service which allows services opers to watch through irc/dcc when
  certain commands are issued to services.
