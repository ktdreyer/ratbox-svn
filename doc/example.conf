  A note on numeric values:
  Times can be written like so:
    3 years 10 minutes 1 second
  The valid units of time are: second, minute, hours, day, week,
                               month (28 days), year (365 days), decade,

  For sizes, you can use: byte, kilobyte/kbyte/kb, megabyte/mbyte/mb,
                          gigabyte/gbyte/gb, terabyte/tbyte/tb.

  Both singular and plurals are accepted for times and sizes.
