*** 20001202_13 by db
- fixed dlinkMoveList, there are three cases to contend with
  1) empty from list 2) empty to list 3) move the spaghetti pointers around



*** 20001202_12 by db
- fixed DEBUG_BLOCK_ALLOCATOR for free_dlink_node case so it will
  no longer core in sprintf.. all the free calls are "wrapped" 
  in ircd_def.h .. to include a file name and line number, without
  free_dlink_node being wrapped, it tried to print a non-existent filename
  oops

- I removed the "wrapped" free_link in ircd_def.h as well no longer used.
  which reminds me...

- LIMIT_UH code in the new world order is currently =broken= until
  it understands how to properly use dlink_node etc. Someone else
  bored and care to fix?

- Added reference counting to dlink_node =for now= *ICK* barf its an
  #ifdef .. I don't want it going out into production like that either adrian.
  I'll remove before the beta cut.



*** 20001202_11 by toot
small bugfix in m_who


*** 20001202_10 by toot
made vchan_map in to a dlink_list,
not tested loads, but it seems to work


*** 20001202_9 by db
- made list_length a generic function moved into tools.c
  renamed as dlink_list_length()



*** 20001202_8 by db
- add code to move a list from one to the other, this makes
  de-opping an entire channel a simple job of moving lists over from
  the chanop list to the peon list.



*** 20001202_7 by db
- real fix for channel.c change_channel_membrship
- fixed missing prototypes in tools.h that would have found previous bug



*** 20001202_6 by toot
typo in m_admin.. blah :)


*** 20001202_5 by toot
. let unregistered clients use /admin, but non hunting
. non-opers can do /time locally.


*** 20001202_4 by toot
fixed some compile errors/typos


*** 20001202_3 by db
- recoded send_members in channel.c so it actually works
  its still a dogs breakfast... but =better=



*** 20001202_2 by db
- connect bursts are still broken, but it works enough to 
  be usable. More debugging to do.
- cleaned up m_nick.c a tiny bit more. what a steeeninkng mess



*** 20001202_1 by db
- change_channel_membership was screwing up, since dlinkDelete does
  not zero the dlink_list->head pointer in all cases. *sigh* dunno
  what I did wrong. anyway, this hack fixes it for now.



*** 20001201_8 by db
- fixed m_who.c
- optimized m_sjoin.c a bit



*** 20001201_7 by db
- fix to whois... this function needs review... it "feels" wrong... sigh



*** 20001201_6 by db
- fixed m_names.c missing reply_to_send = 1

  NOTE that not everything is working yet, notably server link..
  but this doesn't core right away. ;) and appears to run.



*** 20001201_3 by davidt
fixed gettext support a bit, and added some docs

*** 20001201_2 by adrian


aiee! clear the socket timeout *before* calling the timeout handler.
If we clear it after, we miss any timeouts set by the timeout handler.
(think multiple-ping checks ..)


*** 20001201_1 by adrian


add a flush list, which looks precisely like a socket timeout as it is
right now, but its designed to be used if we want to flush data out
at a certain time rather than immedidately.

Think "flood protection".

Note that this is implemented inside the comm_checktimeouts() loop.
This is done because we want to eventually only have exactly *one*
walk of the entire fd list/clients once a second, rather than multiple.



*** 20001130_22 by db
- majorly reworked m_sjoin.c remove_our_ops and channel.c send_mode_list
  because of the original RFC that started this stupidity off, trying to
  do four modes at a time is risky due to possible buffer overflow ;-(
  Taking the time to strlen() before adding to output buffer seems
  CPU intensive to me. soooo back to 3 mode changes per. This should
  speed up sjoin's a lot now.



*** 20001130_21 by db
- rewrote send_mode_list in channel.c The original was pathetic
  strcat this strcpy that. UGH. This should run much faster.



*** 20001130_20 by db
- fixed broken messages stuff for now I'll double check with David tomorrow
- redid how m_sjoin.c did a remove ops



*** 20001130_19 by davidt
m_error.so wasn't being built.

*** 20001130_18 by db
- removed CUSTOM_ERR define no longer needed
- removed offsetof no longer needed



*** 20001130_17 by davidt
Removed CUSTOM_ERR, and changed it to use gettext(), which allows the
message files to be changed at run time, currently using
/quote set MSGLOCALE ... ('custom' for the custom messages, or anything else
to use the standard ircd messages).
Also, added general_message_locale to the new config file.
If gettext() isn't available, it should just use the standard ircd messages.


*** 20001130_16 by db
- fixed core bug in m_names.c
  


*** 20001130_15 by adrian


move read_packet() and parse_client_queued() into packet.c.
s_bsd.c is meant to be a place where BSD socket type stuff
happens, not parsing client messages.

This is the precursor tidyup which will make implementing the recvq
flooding code talk..



*** 20001130_14 by db
- removed the evil local struct Client hack and added a new LocalUser
  "localClient" part. If non NULL, this client struct is a local client..
  I suppose we can now get rid of local_flag?



*** 20001130_13 by adrian


* kill client[] buffer in the Client struct. We don't need this at all
  with the advent of the linebuf
* Tidy up a couple of assert()s to be more tasteful to me
* note that the count; entry in the Client struct is now only used to
  denote local/remote clients with some evil splitting of the client struct
  and memory allocation. This is evil and should be killed at someone's
  earliest convienence and replaced with a LocalClient struct which attaches
  to the end of a struct Client ..




*** 20001130_12 by adrian


* added an Id tag
* we needed to keep those bzero()'s. Hrm, I wonder why ...
  What happened was that we'd have get a line in, and then immediately flush
  some previously printed garbage. Weird.


*** 20001130_11 by db
- similar bug to parse.c in modules.c when increasing moduletable



*** 20001130_10 by db
- added two new parms to parser hide_server hide_chanops yes or no
- added possible fix (untested by adrian?) to parse.



*** 20001130_9 by adrian


We don't need to bzero, now that the memory routines return the memory
zero'ed for us ..



*** 20001130_8 by db
- removed memset() 0 after MyMalloc its done already 



*** 20001130_7 by db
- no need to memset to zero in channel.c now either



*** 20001130_6 by db
- MessageTree stuff should be in parse.h not msg.h
- Seeing as MyMalloc now zeros memory, no need to do it in blalloc



*** 20001130_5 by adrian


bzero() the memory we get from malloc() before returning. This is a good
thing(tm), and it means we can possibly start removing bzero/memset's
from around the code.



*** 20001130_4 by db
- fixed kick so nonops see user kicking themselves in chanop hide mode
- don't show uplink on links and hopcount if in server hide mode



*** 20001130_3 by db
- committed the chanop hiding code. wheeee
  still needs testing



*** 20001130_2 by db
- server names should not be given in /squit messages if
  server hide is turned on



*** 20001130_1 by db
- squished bug in m_names.c which caused the module to suddenly
  throw up when names without a paramter was given. I forgot
  the case where a client had no channels it was on, trying to 
  indirect through a NULL struct Link is bad for the modules health.



*** 20001129_10 by db
- fixed m_squit.c
- account for LazyLink's in channel.c destroy_channel()
  can be used for both persistent channels and lazy links now
  removing more BLOAT
- -O2 in Makefile.in for modules was doing weirdnesses, hard coded to -g for now



*** 20001129_9 by db
- fixed persistent channels
- fixed IsSetCallerId typo



*** 20001129_8 by db
- pile of cleanups mostly in comments
- added persistent channels tentatively for now, finesse it later
- redid s_user.c code to clean that up



*** 20001129_7 by davidt
Directory /cvsroot/ircd-hybrid-7/messages added to the repository


*** 20001129_6 by db
- renamed misnamed log_user_connect -> log_user_exit
- move X line check into separate function (LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
  ALL ALONG)
 



*** 20001129_5 by db
- reworked register_user
  moved all check for conf/kline notification etc. back into s_conf.c
  where I think maybe it belongs, in any case, this cleans up register_user
  no more **char preason. *ugh*
- removed the kludge '|' handling in reasons. *ugh*

  Who knows what evil lies in ircd code...



*** 20001129_4 by db
- redid luser code, removed cache, if this is still needed after all the
  bug fixes done (!) then add an event to recalculate luser counts.

- added user_welcome() function to s_user.c to start factoring this up
  I hate monolithic functions...

  What evil functions lurks in the heart of ircd?, the shad0w knows.




*** 20001129_3 by db
- cleaned up user and oper file logging. use fbopen etc.
  use eventAdd to close user log for resync



*** 20001129_2 by db
- removed more #define's
- cleaned up client.c/client.h some more



*** 20001129_1 by db
- I removed isbot tests. those are quite obsolete and were BLOAT
- I added skeleton for server side ignore new user mode +u
- This adds a new command module "m_accept"
  This code needs to be finished...
- removed rehash gline rehash tkline BLOAT
- tidied up linebuf.c to use \r and \n like K&R intended



*** 20001128_11 by adrian


Revoke FDLIST_BUSYCLIENT for the time being - we need to sort out
how we place things in the fd lists, and we need to keep the flow
of FD events at a steady rate.

The trouble right now is that if we don't have any idle fd's being
triggered, we end up waiting an entire second for their IO to
complete. This is too long. :-)



*** 20001128_10 by db
- removed unused FLUD code



*** 20001128_9 by db
- ripped out FLUD, right idea, wrong approach.



*** 20001128_8 by db
To quote RFC1459.txt

The NOTICE message is used similarly to PRIVMSG.  The difference
   between NOTICE and PRIVMSG is that automatic replies must never be
   sent in response to a NOTICE message.  This rule applies to servers
   too - they must not send any error reply back to the client on
   receipt of a notice.  The object of this rule is to avoid loops
   between a client automatically sending something in response to
   something it received.  This is typically used by automatons (clients
   with either an AI or other interactive program controlling their
   actions) which are always seen to be replying lest they end up in a
   loop with another automaton.

NOTICE now no longer replies with "NO SUCH NICK" if a nick recipient
does not exist etc.



*** 20001128_7 by db
- fixed m_message to work properly. i.e. oper $# messages work
  NO_SUCH_NICK now work properly



*** 20001128_6 by davidt
Fixed broken build

*** 20001128_5 by db

  gah! I am looking forward to the death of the h6 tree. it sucks.



*** 20001127_11 by db
- fixed reference to version in module, its a **char pointer. 



*** 20001127_10 by db
- fixed a few typos



*** 20001127_9 by bill

 - added _moddeinit()


*** 20001127_8 by db
- fixed modload/modunload yes. they work now



*** 20001127_7 by db
- added deinit



*** 20001127_6 by db
- modunload now works. But all modules need to be updated to add a deinit
  function *sigh* I did m_admin.c, 59 more to go



*** 20001127_5 by db
- fixed parse.c and modules.c



*** 20001127_4 by adrian


We should only allow a buffer to be obtained via linebuf_get() if it
is terminated!



*** 20001127_3 by adrian


Add initial documenation of the new linebuf code
(god I love documenting ..)



*** 20001127_2 by db
- interim check in, I hate checking in partially debugged code
  but I have to do some real work for a bit,
  /modunload cores ..



*** 20001127_1 by db
- fixed modules code to use version string as well
- fixed parse to use prefix tree code
- modload modunload hooks in place, need admin flags 
- fixed m_help to use original msgtab 



*** 20001126_10 by db
- got tired of a compile warning



*** 20001126_9 by db
- re-enabled send_operwall



*** 20001126_8 by db

- committed bysin's whois fix



*** 20001126_7 by db
- Seeing as there is next to nothing left of irc2.8 I'm removing
  it from the patchlevel.



*** 20001126_6 by adrian


Hrm, return the number of lines parsed by linebuf_parse() - this'll be
used later on by some anti-flood code at a later date.



*** 20001126_5 by adrian


We don't need these. YAY.



*** 20001126_4 by adrian


Adrian's totally massive evil dbuf die and linebuf code.

* dbuf.c and dbuf.h have gone. Byebye.
* some of the stuff in s_debug.c which reports dbuf stats has been
  #if 0'ed for the time being
* linebuf flushing (ie write()ing to a socket) is now done through
  linebuf_flush() which does the state keeping, saving a whole lot of
  dbuf map/delete and tracking that existed before
* dopacket() was killed, since we now handle line-by-line parsing of both
  server *and* client recvq buffers. dopacket() did some CRLF-type splitting
  magic because a single buffer when doing ZIPLINKS could possibly be
  more than on ircd line.
* deliver_it() was also killed, since we don't need that extra complexity.
* A lot of linebuf fixes are brought in because well, we needed them!


How the linebuf stuff is used (in a nutshell)

* linebuf_put() is called to put a complete line into a buffer. It has
  to be a line.
* linebuf_parse() is called to put one or more lines into a buffer.
  Incomplete lines and multiple lines are handled.
* When a line is terminated, it is appended with a CR/LF/NUL .

  NOTE that the NUL isn't counted in the length!


Ok - this code is very very alpha. It works, and I can link to another
hybrid server. There are a lot of extras I have to add to this code
before it can be used in a public network, like:

* fixing flood protection to take into account alloclen rather than len.
  This is more relevant to memory usage
* fix the flood protection to only appear in one place (ie after
  linebuf_parse() ) rather than the 10935083405 places it exists now
* I should add multiple-size support in the linebuf code, because we might
  end up wanting to support > 512 line buffers for server connections
* .. and yes, we should really test this to break it, to make sure I haven't
  forgotten anything.

*** 20001121_3 by adrian


Add in the beginnings of my new and hopefully improved dbuf replacement.

The general idea here is that we *should* be pre-parsing buffers into lines
so we can later throw references around.

src/dbuf.c throws data into the dbuf and parses it when its coming out.
This code parses data into lines when it comes in, so its already
in a per-line format (minus the trailing CRLFs) when we come to parsing
it.

Its building, but I haven't tested it yet. THAT is next.




*** 20001121_2 by adrian

Actually create a tools module with stuff that is abused reguarly,
and rip some of squid's dlink-list management stuff.

I'll commit some code which uses them soon, so people have something
to work with.

This should remove a *lot* of ugliness/duplication in dlink list
management. :)



*** 20001121_1 by db

*** 20001119_2 by davidt
modularised m_motd, so /MOTD works once again.
motd.c still contains various file reading/sending commands, which are

(quiet_on_ban stuff)
  +o/+v should be able to speak even if banned
  only check local connections, to save CPU, and avoid "desync" messages on mixed nets

  the function to channel_member_names() and placed it into channel.c
  Ignore the mods to src/m_join.c duh. everything m_* in src goes away...

  Eventually in an universe far far away, channel becomes channel.so
  which means, it will have to have a list of dependancies on it to unload
  and reload or something, or maybe just unload all the m_ functions and
  reload autoload? Sometime in an alternate universe...

some fixes in makefile


*** 20001109_6 by ejb
ok basic modules support is almost complete now.
there's a strange bug where some commands make it
exit(1), when i've fixed that all we need is
m_modload, and module UNloading support ..

then maybe modularise more stuff, that's all for
the future though.



*** 20001109_5 by ejb
modules appear to be mostly working now, apart from a small problem with
the mtree that means it won't recognise any commands.
m_error and m_list are now built as part of the core for now..
still no make install for modules/




*** 20001109_4 by db
- only ctcp flud check if local client *oops* This was a side effect
  of combinging ms_privmsg/ms_notice back into one...



*** 20001109_3 by ejb
finished converting modules/*, just some work to do in src/ to make
it compile and stuff now.



*** 20001109_2 by db
- remember, mo_close is only called if an oper, no need to double check



*** 20001109_1 by ejb
convert a few more m_functions, only 8 left to do now.  most of them
will compile, although a couple will not and src/ircd will still not
link.  as i said, will try to fix that tonight.



*** 20001108_8 by ejb
Initial commit of loadable modules support.  right now we can
load modules, but not unload them.  support for adding commands
via modules is there, and about 50% of the m_*.c has been ported.
currently ircd will neither compile nor link properly, but i 
wanted to commit this as soon as possible.. from now on if you
modify m_*.c please edit the version in modules/ rather than
in src/, since src/m_*.c will disappear soon.

i'll try to make another commit tomorrow that fixes compilation,
and allows ircd to be used ..

also we need a modules.txt that explains how to write modules.

so, if you need a working ircd now, sorry, you'll have to wait
until tomorrow :/

(btw if anyone feels like porting the rest of modules/m_*.c (i've done
up to m_operwall.c so far), just look at one of the existing ones
as an example, all you need is the struct Message and _modinit()
function).  as for global symbols defined in modules (this is why
ircd won't link right now), i have a solution to this which i can
hopefully also commit tomorrow.

*** 20001108_2 by adrian


Initial non-optimised version of my fd list code.

The idea is that for the most part, we can detect busy and idle clients
at IO register time (and, at the outside, we can re-decide when we get
a ping back from a client..)

The FD list is passed through comm_setselect() as its second argument.
There will be some weirdnesses where FDs shift lists frequently, but I
will play with this code soon.

Read include/fdlist.h for the list of FD lists.

the actual zip files haven't been removed, since I'm probably going to

*** 20001106_4 by adrian


Finally kill the DNS cache code altogether from the API. gethost_byname()
and gethost_byaddr() now are void functions, rather than struct DNSReply *
functions. If we want to implement a DNS cache, we can do it later with
some callback trickery without having to always check the result and do
trickery in all the client code. (Which makes things hard to follow :-)

The users of gethost_ were converted to assume the callback will be made
at some future time. Note that we can't simply call the callback inside
gethost_ because it'd break things. (What you'd do is have a function
called res_callbackhits() before comm_select() is invoked to do the DNS
callbacks for any cache hits..)



*** 20001106_3 by db
- even more cleanups
  removed a pile of unused #ifdef's lets move these into runtime config

  And oh yes, show oper passwords on failure wasn't is-'s fault. happy now?

  Ok, sjoin from remote server for a vchan is going to be interesting.
currently our vchan map is only kept for local clients. duh.
find_vchan() won't work on a remote client. duh. (vhan_map)
The question now is, do we extend vchan_map to remote clients as well
and fill in the map on sjoins? or figure out its a remote client
and walk the vchan link list instead for remote clients?
*sigh* The map is definitely faster for local clients, as it is filled
in in m_join and m_part etc....
Actually, the idea of caching them as found for remote clients 
sounds like the best compromise...

with REJECT_HOLD, we read() from the fd to flush the buffer, instead of

*** 20001103_7 by adrian


Implementing comm_open(). This is designed to be a socket() and
fd_open() wrapper which limits the number of possible open FDs to
MASTER_MAX (for the time being - better suggestions please :)

So now, you should be either using file_open() / fbopen(), or
comm_open(), and *NOT* any other calls if you can avoid it.
I haven't wrapped dup/dup2/pipe, since the ircd currently does not
use them.



*** 20001103_6 by adrian


* move highest_fd into fdlist.h and out of s_bsd.h for the time

*** 20001103_4 by adrian


local[] is already defined in s_bsd.c, so there is no reason to have

*** 20001103_3 by adrian

Call init_netio() earlier than anything which could

at the time the resolver fd was comm_setselect()ed .

Tidy up the logging during a connection attempt - print a connect message

*** 20001102_5 by adrian


fd_close() is meant to close() the fd, rather than squid's which doesn't
(this is because its got more sane file_open/close and comm_open/close
code ..)

This fixes the fd leak and non-closing fd problems.



*** 20001102_4 by adrian


Initial change over of the server connect() code to use the new world
order(tm).

* Fix a couple of stupidities in my last commit of comm_strerror
* Strip the server connection stuff out of s_bsd.c and move it into
  two functions in s_serv.c - 
  + serv_connect() - initiate a connection to a server (replacing
    connect_server()
  + serv_connect_callback() - completion from comm_connect_tcp() 

Note that there doesn't seem to be checking to see if a /connect server
is actually in the process of being connect'ed. This should happen!

The code works and connects to the server(s) on startup, but /squit and
/connect's fail. I've found that clients that /quit dont have their
sockets closed .. I have to figure that out, which might solve this.

Converting the ident auth code over to use comm_connect_tcp().
Note that this code doesn't entirely work yet, but it doesn't NOT work
(go on, parse that)

* rip the bind() / connect() code out of s_auth.c and use
  comm_connect_tcp() instead

* change send_auth_query() into a CNCB - it is called once 
  comm_connect_tcp() completes in order, and handles errors from
  it before attempting to write to the socket.

* fix comm_connect_tcp() to actually work ! :
  + actually *remember* to record the port
  + don't do DNS lookups on IPs when you want an IP, instead attempt to
    convert it to a in_addr, and if it fails try to look it up with
    gethost_byname()

* Remove all the auth descriptor stuff from send_message(), leaving only
  server connect()s



*** 20001101_4 by adrian


Add a 'local' parameter to comm_connect_tcp() to specify what to bind()
to locally. Currently if NULL is passed no bind() is performed, but later
on this will change to bind() to the virtual server IP if one is
configured.



*** 20001101_3 by adrian

Initial timeout fd stuff. There is no code that uses it yet, but its there
and running for when I (am about to) do.

The idea is that you register a callback to be called after a given time
period has elapsed. This is good for things like checking ping returns,
where you set the timeout period on the fd to be 2*ping, and when you get
a PONG you reset the timeout period. If the socket ever times out, you
get a ping timeout.

Its also going to be used for the up-coming non-blocking connect() code,
where a socket timeout kicks in to prevent a connect() taking too long
to run.

Once check_pings() has been split up, this and the poll/select/etc loop should
be the only two places that walking the entire fd_table[] array is allowed.



*** 20001031_1 by adrian


We should be registering a COMM_SELECT_READ, not WRITE.
The only reason this was working was because the socket was ready
for writing also at the correct time it was ready for reading ..
uhm, sad. :-)

* kill the burst mode code (there are still bits and pieces of the variables

*** 20001030_8 by adrian


kill npollfds and use highest_fd in its place, which is just as good.



*** 20001030_7 by adrian


Optimise the read code. When a connection graduates from the auth state
and is upgraded to a client, its added via comm_setselect() to start
reading data.

* read_packet() has been turned into a PF, so it can be called when a
  FD is ready for reading.

* read_packet() has been stripped quite a bit - we *assume* that there
  will be data returned from the read. If not, thats a socket error

* error handling has been moved into read_packet() instead of its return
  value

* note that the data is put into the dbuf as fast as possible, rather than
  being evil and waiting. I'll fix the DoSability of this code at a later
  date, and without ignoring reads. :-P



*** 20001030_6 by adrian


Big big write optimisation, taking client and server writes into the
new network loop:

* flush_sendq_except() is gone. This was called when data was
  added to a dbuf and a new one needed allocating, probably to
  increase network throughput and decrease dbuf usage. It should
  not be needed now.

* send_queued() has been turned into send_queued_write() which is
  an IO callback now.

* send_message() will now *always* schedule a COMM_SELECT_WRITE
  regardless of how small the sendq is. This should up the
  network throughput and reduce the CPU a little.

* send_queued_write() should be rescheduling a COMM_SELECT_WRITE 
  if the dbuf chain hasn't been drained fully. I'm still 
  researching this to make sure the variable 'more' is set in
  the right places.

* fd shutdown code in s_bsd.c called send_queued() to flush dbufs
  before killing the FD. This obviously can't be done now.
  As noted in a comment, when close handlers are implemented
  correctly, the dbuf will be flushed (or attempted to) before
  the FD closes totally, so we just ignore it here for now.

* Make the old-style poll code not register and check write
  events for FDs that need data written. So now, the only
  thing that can trigger a client/server FD write in the old-style
  poll code is the completion of a connect(). All server/client
  FD writes are done through comm_select() in the new world order.

send_message() could probably attempt to call send_queued_write()
rather than waiting for the fd to be ready for writing, but this
is an optimisation for another time. (And easy too, since the
original code for send_message() called send_queued() anyway,
so there shouldn't be any problems there .. :)

- more cleanups to m_stats.c code 
  both handlers call do_normal_stats
  oper handler calls do_priv_stats normal handler calls do_non_priv_stats
  This should make it way easier to assign appropriate privs



*** 20001030_3 by db
- moved events reporting from /quote events to /stats E
  I think it belongs there since /stats z is memory report
  I'd eventually like to have oper only /stats such as
  /stats events, /stats memory , /stats memory klines
  This could lend itself well to gersh's new malloc memory reporting code...



*** 20001030_2 by db
- reworked m_stats.c some more. no need for valid_stats flag. ick



*** 20001030_1 by db
- cleaned up m_stats.c just a little
  I like Isomers idea of renaming things a bit more, but this is
  a start...



*** 20001029_5 by db
- finally moved check_client from s_bsd.c, where it really never seemed
  to me to belong, moved into s_conf.c 



*** 20001029_4 by db
- viconf.c modified to match hybrid-6 patch, added vimotd check



*** 20001029_3 by lusky
fix for mIRC NAT+spoofedI DCC send problem (userhost now returns sockhost
for acptr==sptr).


*** 20001029_2 by db
- m_sjoin.c is still a mess, but starting to split it up into
  manageable pieces. 



*** 20001029_1 by adrian


Kill the flush_*() routines in send.c, since they add an extra level
of complexity and hackiness to where the code *should* be tidy (and
well, I'm going to tidy).

The closing-ircd-flush will be fixed once close handlers are implemented.
They will be soon.



*** 20001028_8 by adrian


Attempt to indent send_message() because I am about to start hacking
on this code, and this indenting wasn't helping..



*** 20001028_7 by adrian


Neatening up the formatting a little bit. There's no concept of 'valid
callback' here in this codebase.



*** 20001028_6 by db
- typo in s_serv.c in vchan handling
  oopsies



*** 20001028_5 by db
- most of the work is done in m_sjoin, it =should= send the mode
  join messages etc. to the right vchan names now.



*** 20001028_4 by db
- ok, did preliminary mods on sjoin to support vchans.
  This function is a pile of festering pus..
  Anyway, it should more or less work but its untested. Still to be
  done is the mods to the sendto_channel etc. so they all send the right
  join messages to the vchans as appropriate.



*** 20001028_3 by db
- rewrote burst code, added new function to do the actual burst. 'bout time.
  rewrote the burst code to send vchans as sub chans of top level channels.
  Next need to redo SJOIN to paste 'em back into sub vchans from burst



*** 20001028_2 by db
- adds /quote events which will list the event queue
  I'd rather add a generic "debug" function later on i.e. something like
  "/quote debug events" "/quote debug memory" etc. etc. but this will
  do for now...



*** 20001028_1 by adrian


move check_pings() into an event, and tidy up a random comment.
check_pings() is now called once a second to make sure we catch all
pings that should be pong'ed, since nextping isn't reset anywhere
in the code anymore. This isn't entirely optimal, but it will do
until I've tidied up the rest of the network code. When this is
done, I'll optimise check_pings() so it doesn't have to do so much
work to decide whether a client/server should have responded.



*** 20001027_1 by toot
made vchan notices into numeric replies.  276-278 don't seem to be used for anything in
any ircd i checked, so went for them


*** 20001026_6 by adrian


Add an explanation to errno ..



*** 20001026_5 by db
- check_klines() has to be called after placing tklines as well



*** 20001026_4 by adrian


Tidy up Dianora's event-ing of the channel_cleanup() code:

* change the declaration of channel_cleanup() so it matches the EVH
  function prototype

* Change the call to eventAdd() to not need the typecast to EVH ..
* .. to pass NULL instead of 0 ..
* .. and split across two lines so the line isn't > 80 characters




*** 20001026_3 by db
- removed checkpings to localize it in ircd.c only



*** 20001026_2 by db
- messed up 4am commit. Here is the changes to config.h



*** 20001026_1 by db
- cleaned up kline code in client.c
- missing check_klines in m_kline.c



*** 20001025_10 by db
- split check_pings into two (like it should have been all along)
  check_pings checks for ping timeouts
  check_kline checks for klines
  both call common exit routine
  m_kline has to call check_kline after placing a kline. It would be
  better if it was put on the nice event queue incase a tcm or oper
  places several klines in a row. But then, opers freak when a kline
  doesn't happen instantly.



*** 20001025_9 by adrian


ResolverFileDescriptor isn't a global FD anymore, so don't declare it
as one.



*** 20001025_8 by adrian


Convert the auth timeout checking to be once a second. I can't see this
sucking too badly because timeout_auth_queries_event() doesn't walk
the entire fd array - instead it walks AuthPollList.



*** 20001025_7 by db
- added evenAdd for cleanup_channels



*** 20001025_6 by adrian


tidy up the highest_fd handling. Now, the handling is done through
fd_open() / fd_close(), reducing the number of places tracking is
done.



*** 20001025_5 by db
- why I deleted that crucial code I don't know
  anyway, privmsgs to channels now works again.



*** 20001025_4 by adrian


Move the listener code to use comm_setselect(). 

* accept_connection() has changed to become a PF function for use
  with comm_setselect()
* When a listener is created, comm_setselect() is called to make
  the initial IO on the FD work
* reworked read_message() in s_bsd_poll.c to deal with no listen sockets

All read_message() does now (!) is handle auth and client/server sockets.
Here's an excerpt from the code explaining the major real change
that happened:

   * Since we're going to rip this code out anyway, the current "hack"
   * will suffice to keep things going. The only two things this loop
   * services now is the auth and client/server fds (resolver and
   * listener FDs are done through the new-style interface) . So,
   * we loop again through the poll_fdarray[] array from scratch again
   * and fd's that are not -1 are ready for us to do read-type events
   * with. The pollfd_array[i].fd = -1; in the auth fd loop stops us
   * from looking at the auth fds as client/server fds which would be
   * a Bad Thing(tm) right now. :-)    -- adrian

* We have to recheck the incoming connection code to ratelimit the number
  of incoming connections/sec to stop connection flooders. Uhm, there was
  some code in read_message() from comstud to do this, I'll move it out
  into accept_connection() once read_message() has gone away.



*** 20001025_3 by adrian


Just set the nonblocking flag when we set a socket non-blocking ..



*** 20001025_2 by adrian


Use the pre-munged poll flags for network IO, rather than creating
our own set of POLL* flags.



*** 20001025_1 by db
- removed NO_JOIN_ON_SPLIT
- cleaned up m_join.c a bit
- removed a pile of uneeded #ifdef's



*** 20001024_4 by adrian


Commit the tidyup of the resolver network code (notice I said *network* :) 
-->

* move init_resolver() to a more useful init place and out of init_netio()
* make the DNS timeout checking an event which is triggered once a second.
  I figure that when I rewrite the event system soon to work on milliseconds
  rather than seconds we might revisit this, but doing it once a second
  actually might be better. Dunno yet..
* add comm_setselect() calls in the resolver init and just after the
  recvfrom() to re-register interest in IO.
* remove the evilness in read_message() which does the IO on
  ResolverFileDescriptor, making resolver IO happen through the new network
  IO system

Notes:

* I have *NO* idea how the DNS write flushing works just yet, I guess I'm
  about to find out.

* The resolver might take a little longer - this is simply the by-product
  of shoehorning in the comm_select() call (if there is no other pending
  IO, read_message() can delay for a bit, since the resolver fd isn't
  covered there.) Once read_message() disappears, so will the delays.
  (or I might just fix it somehow..)



*** 20001024_3 by adrian


Remember to initialise the event subsystem early so we can use it.



*** 20001024_2 by adrian


Arrays start at 0, not 1 in C. When we find out the lowest numbered fd,
we need to make sure npollfds is one more than that value, otherwise the
last filedescriptor won't get polled.



*** 20001024_1 by adrian


Commit the fd state tidyup and new IO loop code.

* I've killed GlobalFDList and replaced it with an array of fd structs.         
  (fde_t). This has the fd state (opened, closed, pending io requests,          
  type, description, etc).                                                      
* I've added fd state tracking stuff (fd_open / fd_close).                      
* I've added file fd state tracking stuff (file_open / file_close)              
* I've tidied up logfile permissions in a place or two                          

There's a little weirdness - if you want to include s_bsd.h, you need
to include fdlist.h as well. This will go away eventually ..



*** 20001023_7 by ryan

changed around order things are done to prevent non-base channel pointer
from being used where base channel pointer should be


*** 20001023_6 by db
- modified cjoin to use the ##channel_name as given in original spec
  this should help us slightly in m_sjoin.c
- started cleaning up m_sjoin.c
- duplicated voodoo code into mo_join.. in m_join.c
  handlers still need a lot of cleanup due to the duplicated code...



*** 20001023_5 by toot
fixed channel.c/remove_empty_channels() so it compiled with 
PRESERVE_CHANNELS #defined


*** 20001023_4 by adrian


Added a port of squid's event system. This is a very simple mechanism
to schedule events to happen in some given time period. The main
function you'll be using is:

eventAdd(const char *text, EVH *func, void *data, time_t when, int weight)

where when is the number of seconds you want to have the event run (so
if you want it running a second from now, you'd set when to be 1.)

Read event.c for a more precise description.

What has changed:

* changed this over to use the Block allocator rather than squid's mempools
* disabled debug reporting until I figure out a nice way (ie how the rest
  of the ircd does it) of doing this
* made the time offsets integer, rather than double like they are in squid
* the logic in io_loop() has been changed to allow this to slide in.

Note that eventAddIsh()'s logic on random offsets might be a bit .. off.
I'll come back to this once I've tidied up bits of the code.

I will also be tidying up io_loop() now an event scheduling mechanism
exists, making it much, much less twisted. So any breaks there will
(hopefully) be temporary.



*** 20001023_3 by adrian





first split of the network code into per-commloop modules. The autoconf
magic came from the squid commloops work by Adrian Chadd (me) and
Benno Rice (benno@holocaine.net).

the poll and select specific stuff was moved into s_bsd_poll.c and
s_bsd_select.c . The chosen file is done through some autoconf magic
and variable substitution in src/Makefile.in. I haven't changed any
code itself, simply un-staticized things and shifted things into
seperate files. This is done to preserve some form of CVS sanity.

A noteable here is that I"ve moved the FD_SETSIZE detection for
select() into s_bsd_select.c rather than ircd.c, since this is a more
logical place to check (and die) if FD_SETSIZE < MAXCONNECTIONS.

The autoconf configuration is done using the following options to
configure:

--enable-poll / --disable-poll : Enable or disable the use of poll()
--enable-select / --disable-select : ENable or disable the use of select()

Note that the current autoconf magic checks if poll() exists - since
we aren't using USE_POLL now, we define ac_cv_func_poll/select/whatever
and this is used further into the autoconf magic to decide the
substitutions to do.

- stats p notice.
- removed some old non-TS cruft.
- unreg users can't send version.
- added +a umode, shows oper is admin in whois 
  if they are 'admin=yes'.
- users can see the topic of a -s channel they aren't
  on (but can't set it even if it is -t, to prevent
  topic floods *sigh*)
- many changes in parse.c .. fixed a few bugs, rewrote
  the argument parser code, added support for catching
  users passing not enough parms before the m_ function
  is even called.
- you can now set in ircd.conf whether channels have to
  be +i for an invite to work.
- added a numeric (504) for sending to users trying to
  invite remote users to +i channels.
- started changing m_* functions to not check parc anymore,
  in most cases parse() has already handled this.
- move glines from config.h to ircd.conf
plus a lot of other stuff i probably forgot.

- changed CONFIG_H_LEVEL_6 to CONFIG_H_LEVEL_7
- updated config.h.dist to match config.h



*** 20000402_2 by db
- Pointed out by "is" with non standard p vs. s this else if is wrong
  "is" <ejb@debian.org>



*** 20000402_1 by db
- This bug caused only the first connection in a class to be tried
  i.e. if you had several C: lines in one =class= only the first
  C: line was ever used. This is code that was #ifdef'd out from original
  hybrid-5                    



*** 20000401_1 by db
- removal of #define kludge for GlobalSetOptions



*** 20000330_1 by db

*** 20000201_1 by db
- converted separate user/host forms to user="user@host.part"; forms
  it looks nicer, and easier for admins to work with I think. Plus recommended
  by the #coder-com crew. ok.
- fixed stupid in initconf where it missed # commented out lines and
  tried to parse old format as new...
- folded in the old -5 nick collide code already folded into the -6 tree.
  its #ifdef'ed for future fixes...



*** 20000131_1 by db
- improvements to connect section. allow multiple hub_masks etc.



*** 20000124_3 by db
- first work on logging section, 
  logging level can be set from new conf file format now.



*** 20000124_2 by db
- updated convertconf



*** 20000124_1 by db
- removed #ifdef for ZIP_LINKS
  I hate #ifdef's



*** 20000123_2 by db
- added fbunputc mimics unputc (Sorry Tom)
- single conf file, is either old style or new style determined
  at initconf time (Again, sorry Tom)
  Could have done it simpler, but this is safer for now...



*** 20000123_1 by db
- cleaned up some "bare" 512 defines. added new IRCD_BUFSIZE define
- added better error recovery to parser, 
- added better error reporting.
- tentative new conf format mostly finished, will "warp" it a bit
  more to match Kev's proposed format as possible, given undernet vs.
  efnet differences..
- need to handle ircd.conf form as the new format as default,
  and fall back to old format as needed. i.e. kludge code still to 
  be removed in source...



*** 20000122_1 by db
- more cleanup on new conf file parser..
  using "auth" instead of "client" as per Kev's document..



*** 20000121_1 by db
- preliminary serverinfo section done



*** 20000120_1 by db
- CONNECT in new parser works, needs full testing



*** 20000117_3 by db
- added a few more sections



*** 20000117_2 by db
- Added quarantine



*** 20000117_1 by db
- continuing with new parser code... listen/operator tested



*** 20000116_7 by db
- bunch of changes in order to have class names not numbers. *sigh*
  I toyed with the idea of keeping class #'s and having class_names
  to class #' mapping somewhere, but thats just getting silly.. sooo....
  Here we are...



*** 20000116_6 by db
- make_class should return a 0'ed class to be safe



*** 20000116_5 by db
- prelim. change before I start on class names



*** 20000116_4 by db
- oper section complete except for class operations..



*** 20000116_3 by db
- checkpoint with operator section mostly working...
  class code has to be rewritten still



*** 20000116_2 by db
- oops. I changed Makefile rather than Makefile.in



*** 20000116_1 by db
- copyright touch ups
- missing -ll in Makefile



*** 20000115_3 by db
- The lex/yacc files...



*** 20000115_2 by db
- first very rough working lex/yacc under ircd-hybrid..
  parser doesn't actually do anything.... yet...
  Tom, we could use a fileio pushback, to push back a line thats
  "not for us"



*** 20000115_1 by db
- more cleanups to parse code



*** 20000113_3 by db
- someone forgot to add a file. wonder who



*** 20000113_2 by db
- externalized the old parser, unfortunately, this means a lot
  more of the s_conf interface is visible ;-(, can do better in the future...
  This is in preparation for new parser inclusion.
  This will (ick) allow us to use both old conf files and new format conf files
  for backwards compatibility. (I'm not terribly happy about this, but...
  Hi Tom!)



*** 20000113_1 by db
- updated client/deny sections to use new IP_TYPE
- fixed union to use struct ip_value



*** 20000112_1 by db
- returned to ';' at end of each section, this is actually easier to
  recover from errors; just scan for ';'
- updated convertconf to produce test file
- added IP token to lexer and to client section



*** 20000111_11 by db
- added DENY 



*** 20000111_10 by db
- more work on yacc/lex parser
  added "kill" open to discussion, but efnet has "K" and "D" lines
  


*** 20000111_9 by db
- changes to bring it into line with Kev's sample conf just a tiny bit
- removed that dumb ';' at end of sections



*** 20000111_8 by db
- tiny cleanup to Makefile
  Copyright notice fixed 



*** 20000111_7 by db
- added preliminary yacc/lex test parser code



*** 20000111_6 by db
Directory /usr/hybrid/ircd-hybrid-7/src/test/newconf added to the repository


*** 20000111_5 by db
- oops port in connect was quoted



*** 20000111_4 by db
- more tiny tweaks



*** 20000111_3 by db
- tweaks to new conf format



*** 20000111_2 by db
- sample ircd.conf and its converted ircd.conf.new 



*** 20000111_1 by db
- Now pretty much handles a "normal" conf file.. output is
  a "new" style conf format file, with details still to be hashed out.
  Do we want to handle multiple C/N's ? multiple H lines? *sigh* yes
  Thats next, but not yet.
 


*** 20000110_4 by db
- tiny tweak much more to do



*** 20000110_3 by db
- Nearly done. TODO Finish off I lines (I line prefixes)
  HUB or LEAF control set in old M line



*** 20000110_2 by db
- updated Makefile, fleshed out convertconf more



*** 20000110_1 by db
- small cleanup to s_conf.c before the bigger one



*** 20000109_12 by wnder
woopsies


*** 20000109_11 by wnder
Added documentation of the iauth protocol


*** 20000109_10 by db
- bit more fleshing out of convertconf.c



*** 20000109_9 by db
- first rough outline of conversion program to convert old style
  to new style conf file format. No Makefile, incomplete still.



*** 20000109_8 by db
- more cleanups, made consistent... no need for MSG_PRIVMSG/MSG_NOTICE
  other m_ files don't do that



*** 20000109_7 by db
- cleanups



*** 20000109_6 by db
- m_mode bursts/looks for channel mode on uplink in LazyLinks code



*** 20000109_5 by db
- removed uneeded #include



*** 20000109_4 by db
- forgot to remove now unused m_message.c



*** 20000109_3 by db
- split m_privmsg and m_notice into two files. My rationale for doing this
  is: slightly faster, no more if(notice) in code, m_privmsg/m_notice
  rarely change anyway.



*** 20000109_2 by wnder
Added support for when SerialNumber rolls over to 0


*** 20000109_1 by db
- as fbgets is re-entrant, redid .include code. Much nicer



*** 20000108_5 by wnder
Implemented serial number method to keep track of searched nodes.
(hi diane!!)


*** 20000108_4 by db
- LazyLinks /list on leaf is sent to its uplink now
- still bug to track down with leaf connected to hub, hub joins net
  leaf does not see channel bursts properly



*** 20000108_3 by wnder
Implemented unsortable I/K lines


*** 20000108_2 by db
- still slowly working in LazyLinks version 2 code. nick collides
  have to be handled by the LazyLinks uplink, for now sending back
  KILL's (which were removed!) as needed...



*** 20000108_1 by wnder
fixed missing #include "s_conf.h"


*** 20000107_4 by db
- sticky / key



*** 20000107_3 by db
- don't core if chptr == NULL in sendto_match_servs()
  shouldn't normally ever happen, but does in LL 



*** 20000107_2 by db
- closer version of LazyLinks version 2



*** 20000107_1 by db
- split out m_user.c m_nick.c, modified s_user.c s_user.h Makefile.in
  LazyLinks is in unworkable state in this version.



*** 20000106_1 by db
- fixed bug introduced in ReplaceQuotes, '\#' was not handled correctly.



*** 20000105_16 by db
- all over the place



*** 20000105_15 by db
- yet another hidden HUB in .h



*** 20000105_14 by db
- removed more pesky #ifdef HUB hidden in .h files



*** 20000105_13 by db
- always initialize serverMask



*** 20000105_12 by db
- HUB removed, server determines if its HUB or LEAF by looking
  at (Now unused) port line in M line. If its a 1, its a HUB, if
  its missing or anything else, its a LEAF.
  Can be queried from /admin
  Yes, its a hack for now.



*** 20000105_11 by db
- removed HUB from config.h etc. now in a config entry



*** 20000105_10 by db
- allow single dot in user names to allow for "first.last" user name style



*** 20000105_9 by db
- removed unneeded include



*** 20000105_8 by db
- oops. missed comment in m_lljoin.c



*** 20000105_7 by db
- oops. removed comments belonging to channel.c only



*** 20000105_6 by db
- committing the split out m_cburst.c m_drop.c m_lljoin.c



*** 20000105_5 by db
- split out m_drop.c m_cburst.c m_lljoin.c



*** 20000105_4 by db
- further cleanups to s_conf.c



*** 20000105_3 by db
- Further cleanups to s_conf.c



*** 20000105_2 by db
- fixed missing Y line detection code which got broken in clean up



*** 20000105_1 by db
- cleanups to dbuf code. Try to flush connections if dbuf list is
  empty then try to allocate.
- tiny start on new channel hierarchy scheme.



*** 20000104_6 by wnder
Prettied up source files by converting tabs to spaces


*** 20000104_5 by db
- fixed DEBUG error in s_conf.c



*** 20000104_4 by db
- also report how many malloc()'ed dbufs there were max



*** 20000104_3 by db
- changed slightly wording in LazyLinks As Implemented doc
- removed more DEBUGLL debug cruft
- simplified m_join CBURST call



*** 20000104_2 by db
- added "Lazy Links As Implemented in Hybrid" doc



*** 20000104_1 by db
- removed more #ifdef's removed BAN_INFO BAN_UH



*** 20000103_7 by db
- mods to try to flush connections if dbufs are used up



*** 20000103_6 by db
- it all works now (LL). channel cleanup etc. 



*** 20000103_5 by db
- this version doesn't core as often. *sigh*
  cleanup channels code needs to be gone over again, its stable
  without.
- removed some cruft and useless comments from client.c



*** 20000103_4 by db
- *sigh* code got lost in the shuffle
  fix stats c so n lines show as n not N
  fix spacing on 333 numeric to match others




*** 20000103_3 by db
- removed last vestige of TOPIC_WHO define



*** 20000103_2 by db
- fixed a typo in ircd.c



*** 20000103_1 by db
- Folded in Perly's cleanup channel code. The idea is to remove
  channels from the lazylinks leaf server if no local members are on them
  and they haven't been used by anyone locally in a "while" where
  "while" is set in s_serv.h CLEANUP_CHANNELS_TIME seconds.
  I've redone the destroy channel code. It should work, but its untested.
  CLEANUP_CHANNELS_TIME is set way low still for debugging,
  its currently 30 seconds. In production it could range from 15 to 60 minutes
  I'd guess.



*** 20000102_9 by db
- key handling was broken in m_cburst



*** 20000102_8 by db
- oops got an if backwards key when NULL cores it



*** 20000102_7 by db
- try to negotiate a non LL connect if serverMask's get all used up
- report all serverMask's used up. That will mean a recode ;-)



*** 20000102_6 by db
- fixed a bug in m_join.c
- cleaned up LL channel key handling
- don't assign serverMask's to non LL servers



*** 20000102_5 by db
- added LazyLinks.txt document outlining original Lazy Links protocol
  its been modified for -7
- ensure serverMask of 0 just causes restoreUnusedServerMask to return



*** 20000102_4 by db
- First working Lazy Links implementation
  still needs debugging/testing etc.



*** 20000102_3 by db
- bug reported by Colten Edwards in m_userhost.c



*** 20000102_2 by db
- oops bogus code in m_sjoin.c



*** 20000102_1 by db
- few tidy ups in prelim LL code



*** 20000101_4 by db
- implemented DROP, not tested, not used yet.



*** 20000101_3 by db
- Preliminary rough cut at Lazy Links, still a lot of mopping up to do
  'n' in c/n's means try lazy link, 'N' means do normal.



*** 20000101_2 by db
- Cleanups to allow DEBUGMODE to compile



*** 20000101_1 by db
- cleanup of LITTLE_I_LINES #ifdef



*** 19991231_4 by db
- renamed channel to GLobalChannelList in jupe channel code



*** 19991231_3 by db
- more cleanup of s_conf.c



*** 19991231_2 by db
- Preliminary cleanups on s_conf.c



*** 19991231_1 by db
- missing NULL assignment would cause double free's and eventual
  core on malformed U: lines.



*** 19991230_11 by wnder
more iauth fixups - this should finish it!


*** 19991230_10 by wnder
IAuth fixups


*** 19991230_9 by db
- oopsies in opcount code spotted by Perly.. flag has to be used
  before set...



*** 19991230_8 by db
- more missed updates local_cptr_list -> LocalClientList



*** 19991230_7 by db
- missed a opcount-- in m_sjoin.c
- missed an #endif for IAUTH



*** 19991230_6 by db
- Added chanop counter to Channel struct, keep track of current op count
  use instead of that nasty loop in SJOIN code



*** 19991230_5 by db
- folding back in USE_IAUTH code



*** 19991230_4 by db
- completion of mop up of resync with -6 tree. Compiles again



*** 19991230_3 by db
- mop up of resync of -7 with -6



*** 19991230_2 by db
- mop up -7 tree resync with -6



*** 19991230_1 by db
resync with current ircd-hybrid-6 tree



*** 19991217_1 by db
1) folded in d line fix from -6
2) folded in res.c core bug fix from -6



*** 19991109_1 by db
- changes to sendto_one_type to not send @# style of message to non
  CHW servers
- m_userhost old behaviour restored, but rewritten. Need to support
  up to 5 userhost requests, this fixes ircle clients which depend on
  this behaviour.



*** 19991022_1 by db
- disallow -ve limit on mode #channel +l 



*** 19991017_2 by db
- missing mask check in IP kline code. no idea why.



*** 19991017_1 by db
- removed (+) cruft as this was a Tanerism



*** 19991013_10 by tomh
Removed CONNECTFAST garbage, it was causing production boxes to load up on
SYNs on the primary port and killing poll performance.


*** 19991013_9 by lusky
fixed m_ison to put trailing space on 303 responses
CONNECTFAST is always defined for USE_POLL now, was causing very poor
  accept performance on heavily loaded non-Solaris machines using poll()


*** 19991013_8 by tomh
put USE_POLL back in setup.h.in, removed stuff that wasn't needed


*** 19991013_7 by lusky
syncd config.h.dist to config.h


*** 19991013_6 by wnder
missing macros


*** 19991013_5 by lusky
updated opers.txt to include set log


*** 19991013_4 by db
- fixed misnomer



*** 19991013_3 by db
- corrected table in s_log.c for log level to string



*** 19991013_2 by db
- added strings to m_set LOG



*** 19991013_1 by db
- botched wild card matching fixed



*** 19991011_1 by db
  It turns out, that cptr->fd is <0 in some cases when its being used, just
as Q described. I was confused at first, because it sounded like he
was saying cptr was =freed= then being used. It appears its still a valid
pointer, but its fd has been closed...

  The ideal solution would be to make sure the cptr is removed from the 
channel link list before the code even gets to sendto_common_channels()

  In any case, using an fd < 0 in this section is a BAD THING 



*** 19991009_1 by db
- better fix for umode code



*** 19990925_1 by db
- simpler mode letter to bit mask table lookup, safer



*** 19990924_2 by db
- yet another ->name instead of ->user this one in report_tklines



*** 19990924_1 by db
- This patch corrects a case where a normal user can oper themselves. oops.
- It also corrects a possible core due to a bogus H or L line. (neph)



*** 19990914_1 by wnder
IAuth updates:
 * mtree.c is (hopefully) approaching it's final stages - much
   more bulletproof now.


*** 19990913_1 by wnder
IAuth updates:
 * added a new mtree module - handles I: and K: lines. Please

Ok, sorry for the broken compile - I put all the iauth code
in the ircd tree under #ifdef USE_IAUTH so hopefully nothing

ircd needs these changes to work with iauth - as of right now,
ircd attempts a connection to 127.0.0.1 port 4444 where it
expects the IAuth server to be - you just need to run
-7/iauth/source/iauth first so it listens on 4444. In the future,
the iauth host/port will be dynamically configurable.
