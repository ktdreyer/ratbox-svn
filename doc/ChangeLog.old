. fixed /mode #chan giving weird replies
. removed some old commented code in channel.c


*** 20010101_3 by db
- just stuck an early draft of this into cvs



*** 20010101_2 by wcampbel
make depend needs to have the CFLAGS in addition to -MM.
This is for making sure that the error messages associated with gcc
not being able to find /usr/local/include/libintl.h don't crop up.


*** 20010101_1 by wcampbel
Updated my part of the TODO list


*** 20001231_31 by wcampbel
1. Added A1kmm's match.c patch (to fix gecos blocks)
2. Fix compiler error in m_part.c (chname -> name)


*** 20001231_30 by davidt
Uhmm.. or should part be the top chan name between servers?
argh. see bug #15


*** 20001231_29 by toot
removed a cvs tag from ChangeLog, and fixed some of my typos :P


*** 20001231_28 by davidt
parting a vchan should send vchan->chname to remote servers....

*** 20001231_27 by toot

*** 20001231_26 by toot
it didn't :P
char *_version = "<dollar>Revision: 1.35 <dollar>"; looks a bit poo

- added spookey to Hybrid-team. 



*** 20001231_19 by davidt
Fixes to allow @#chan and +#chan to work correctly.


*** 20001231_18 by db
- really ANONOPS is way longer than any other capability we have
  lets shorten it to AOPS ok?



*** 20001231_17 by db
- optimized can_join a bit
  No need to generate an expensive to generate string twice, so added
  check_banned as a helper function for is_banned that way can share
  the strings from can_join
- make_nick_user_host was being called, then strcpy'ed. dumb. why not
  tell it where to generate the string in the first place? and remove
  a dumb strcpy?



*** 20001231_16 by spookey

Added Riedel's REHASH CHANNELS patch


*** 20001231_10 by lusky
- david (accidentally?) moved the %type's back to the top, they've got
  to be below the %tokens.


*** 20001231_9 by toot
. changed most remaining param counts so that parse() checks them
. servers don't send USER any more do they? - removed some checks
  which were only used for that anyway..
. removed a few more redundant checks, which parse() takes care of
. show "*" inplace of Nick for unregged users with no nick


*** 20001231_8 by spookey
 - minor cleaups


*** 20001231_7 by davidt
Attempt to fix various issues with channel modes.. although there are still a few bugs left :/

*** 20001231_6 by toot
. fixed a possible overflow in m_list with persistant vchans
. moved the vchan_id setting into remove_user_from_chan so the user
  is still in a dlink_list :P


*** 20001231_5 by lusky
- fixed make distclean for gnats


*** 20001231_4 by db
- hard to find typo in ircd_parser.y yyval instead of yylval
  caused it to core parsing message_local="string";




*** 20001231_3 by db
- this is some very old fugly hacked code we had in hybrid-6 to 
  allow multiple Q lined nicks ... never mind it was a hack, its
  gone. 

- also moved the %type block back in ircd_parser.y until debugged
  the set locale code. 



*** 20001231_2 by db
- fixed logic in m_stats.c pertaining to o_lines_oper_only



*** 20001231_1 by db
- added check for unknown type in proc_answer in res.c 
  only rudimentary logging added for now.
- check for enough parameters in m_invite.c core bad, not enough parms good.



*** 20001230_25 by fl_
- reverted back to old behaviour of only chanops seeing +e/+I


*** 20001230_24 by lusky
- more solaris fixes, should now build and install cleanly


*** 20001230_23 by db
- *red face* backed out a change I thought about making but forgot to
  remove a ')'



*** 20001230_22 by db
- quick hack for now (adrian, forgive me, for I have sinned)

    /* XXX NOT the right "solution" */
#if 0
    assert(fd >= 0);
#endif
    if(fd < 0)
      return;




*** 20001230_21 by davidt
Only resync the channel if required..

*** 20001230_20 by davidt
- Create a new capability: CAP_ANONOPS for servers that support +a
- Fix +a so it's only sent to servers supporting it
- Fix +a so that nonops still see modes they should, but as server modes.
- Fix sendto_channel_local to send NONOPS messages to voiced users too.


*** 20001230_19 by lusky
- check for strings.h for bzero() on solaris

- replace strsep() with strtoken()


*** 20001230_15 by lusky
- oops, forgot an arg to sprintf


*** 20001230_14 by lusky
- missed another setenv()


*** 20001230_13 by lusky
- eradicated setenv(), it's not portable.  specifically sol2.6 doesn't
  have it.


*** 20001230_12 by fl_
- Fix for IP klines 
- We now check to see if remote klines exist locally, before applying them


*** 20001230_11 by db
- removed ';' that were in the wrong spot, these caused bison and solaris
  yacc to have a fit.



*** 20001230_10 by db
- chptr->vchan_id will never be a NULL pointer so the test wasn't doing
  anything at all. Its declared as 
  char            vchan_id[NICKLEN*2];   /* use this for empty vchans */
  not a char *; One could do if[chptr->vchan_id[0]) but then once set
  vchan_id[0] would never be null either.



*** 20001230_9 by toot
added a paranoid check in pick_vchan_id


*** 20001230_8 by lusky
- use errno.h instead of sys/errno.h.  freebsd and redhat don't care, but
  solaris does.


*** 20001230_7 by toot
moved the code that set vchan_id up


*** 20001230_6 by lusky
- more compile warning fixes.  mmmm, socklen_t.  compiles on redhat6.1 now
  without warnings (if you fix the broken /usr/include/bits/socket.h
  by hand).


*** 20001230_5 by lusky
- more compile warning fixes, /modules compiles cleanly on freebsd3.4 now


*** 20001230_4 by lusky
- more cleanups
- fixes /usr/local/include/rsa.h snafu from last commit


*** 20001230_3 by db
- committing madmax's links patch before it gets lost 



*** 20001230_2 by lusky
- more cleanups, /src now compiles without warnings on fbsd3.4


*** 20001230_1 by lusky
more massive cleanups of compiler warnings


*** 20001229_28 by lusky
started cleanup of compiler warnings


*** 20001229_27 by lusky
- hack to make the developer CFLAGS the default.  You can still set CFLAGS in
  your environment before running configure if you want to override them.


*** 20001229_26 by lusky

*** 20001229_20 by lusky
updated TODO


*** 20001229_19 by lusky
- added rm config.cache to make autoconf
- fixed configure to find gettext() in /usr/local/lib/libintl.a
- kludge in config.h so HAVE_GETTEXT follows HAVE_LIBINTL
- custom.mo shouldn't be in the respository
- removed HAVE_GETTEXT from m_info, USE_GETTEXT is what we care about


*** 20001229_18 by davidt
Stop LL leafs replying to MODEs from servers with another MODE..
this should never happen, but it is currently (see bug #7 on hybzilla).


*** 20001229_17 by fl_
- removed the sendto_match_noncap_servs(), as its now redundant
- if a user sets mode +h nick, and hes on a server that doesnt support
  halfops, he would be opped.  we still pass the +h as far as possible,
  but do nothing to that user



*** 20001229_16 by wcampbel
"Permission Denied-" -> "Permission Denied -"
This has been driving me crazy


*** 20001229_15 by wcampbel
Put in Riedel's revised operguide.txt, thanks a lot!


*** 20001229_14 by wcampbel
1. Added links_notice to example.conf
2. Corrected Riedel's nick in ChangeLog
3. Fixed some general {} settings in ircd_parser.y (stats_p_notice, glines)


*** 20001229_13 by wcampbel
Minor correction to send.txt


*** 20001229_12 by fl_

- Added sendto_match_noncap_servs to send.c, and documented it
- Send mode #channel +h nick as +h via sendto_match_cap_servs, and as +o
  via sendto_match_noncap_servs, thus keeping the channel synced
- Updated my todo


*** 20001229_11 by db
- fixed bug in m_sjoin.c that cored server. Non local servers being
  introduced via sjoin and given by sptr, do not have a LocalUser part
  hence, this field is NULL and will core if you try to refernce the caps
  field using IS_CAP()



*** 20001229_10 by fl_

- fixed a bug I made which caused a -o nick when they werent being deopped


*** 20001229_9 by fl_

- gave myself a todo list..


*** 20001229_8 by fl_

- +e/+I modes can now only be seen by chanops


*** 20001229_7 by davidt
Fix gettext() for FreeBSD (LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" ./configure).
Anyone with autoconf knowledge know how to make it check /usr/local/lib
automagically?


*** 20001229_6 by madmax
Links are now stored in the file in a format resembling normal links output
ie "servername uplink(me.name) :hops(1) info"
This makes it look a bit prettier in mirc etc ;)
Also it now outputs me.name in the links list (again for consistency).


*** 20001229_5 by toot
flame's right.. there's no need to send +e/+I when you get opped
in a +a chan.


*** 20001229_4 by toot
. hide H in version with hide_server
. use MAXMODEPARAMS rather than 4 in the +a sync stuff


*** 20001229_3 by db
- increased MessageFileLine length this should be malloced ;-/
- added server info to user seen /links



*** 20001229_2 by db
- fixed another bug in s_conf.c
  recheck_class() had the bad side effect of moving opers from oper
  class to their old class on a /rehash... It also had the side effect
  of dropping already made connections.. not cool Its not necessary
  to recheck classes as it happens... fixed.



*** 20001229_1 by db
- ok. this is the first cut at building an user readable /links
  from doing our own /links and storing in a file for off line use.



*** 20001228_38 by fl_

1. Added error message if user is unopped, and does a /mode #chan +e
2. +b/+d modes are no longer shown to be removed/placed when a user is
   deopped/opped in a +a channel, they can see the lists anyway so they
   dont need us to keep them in sync..
3. If you -h'd someone on a +a channel, they didnt see the -h: fixed
4. If the channel is +a, /mode #chan +d wont tell you who set the ban if
   youre unopped, same as +b

I wanted to remove the +e/+I mode from the sync too.. need to wait to
talk to david first tho. :)

Try to keep +a channels synced up with the clients.
When a channel goes +a, tell everyone that the channel has been massdeoped
When it goes -a, tell everyone that the ops have been mass oped..
When an individual user is opped/deoped, tell only them.

- updated dependancy file accordingly


*** 20001228_9 by davidt
It would also core sending the failure message.. bleh.

Massive bunch of fixes for LazyLinks.
INVITE now works if a hub is trying to relay an INVITE to a LL leaf
which doesn't know about the channel yet.
TOPIC now works if a user on a LL leaf tries to get the topic for a
channel the leaf doesn't know about
Hubs now only send MODE changes to LL leafs that know about the user
coredump in LLJOIN fixed..
some other misc stuff too...


*** 20001227_11 by db
- wrong parmcount, cores each of unkline, undline, ungline



*** 20001227_10 by db
- use the parameter block, don't core on 0 parameters for dline



*** 20001227_9 by davidt

*** 20001227_8 by davidt
Added back /quote set msglocale, which vanished mysteriously when
the new table-based SET code was comitted.
Reworked the argument handling for the SET handlers in the process,
handlers can now take: char; char, int; or int; arguments.


*** 20001227_7 by db

*** 20001227_1 by db
- pathological case would cause a core. If someone fed back the
  same server as the server as "me" it would core since there would be
  no ->from... This bug looks like it would be in hybrid-5, hybrid-6

*** 20001226_6 by db
- fixed bug in m_nick, leafs always should send their nick changes
  since a leaf always introduces all of its clients to their uplink
  but hubs should continue to watch they do not send nick changes for
  clients that have not been introduced yet to leafs.



*** 20001226_5 by db
- number of wrong counts in the parmcount table.. caused these to core
  parc inludes the source as well as arguments



*** 20001226_4 by db
- lljoin was checking for arg count, when thats no longer necessary
  given the new parser

- parser got the parc count off by one when checking for vality, off by one
  error.. also cleaned up formatting

- modules.c two functions were referring to basename() which had been 
  changed to irc_basename()

- s_serv.c was sending topic to servers that didn't see that server on
  channel, changed interface so s_serv.c bursts topic info to lazyleaf
  as well as setting topic

- changed m_topic.c to allow servers to set topic and topic info



*** 20001226_3 by db
- don't burst the TOPIC in s_serv.c until there is a ms_topic() handler
  the server isn't on channel so the leaf will send back an not on channel
  numeric to the server!

- cleaned up setting of fd_note in m_nick()... in both cases it
  is known the nick is local, as non local nicks are handled in separate
  function.



*** 20001226_2 by db
- fix core in m_list.c if /list of non-existent channel is done. oops

 - moved basename() to irc_basename() -- compatability issue with old glibc systems (string.h used to declare basename())


*** 20001225_20 by wcampbel
Updated dependencies


*** 20001225_19 by ejb
- fix knock paramcount
- make knock use +p to stop it, not +s


*** 20001225_18 by wcampbel
1. Noted that auth blocks with redirection MUST have a class
2. is- says anonops is hideops


*** 20001225_17 by db
- I'm not sure how this ever worked before..
  yylval.string should be DupString'ed in MOST cases before adding to conf
  link list

  UNTESTED folks, sorry have to do the Christmas day family visiting thing NOW



*** 20001225_16 by ejb
- allow remote whois.


*** 20001225_15 by toot
replaced some ConfigFileEntry.hide_server with GlobalSetOptions.hide_server


*** 20001225_14 by ejb
- split out some of parse() into a couple of new functions,
  handle_command() and string_to_array().


*** 20001225_13 by toot
. don't want it to say its listing pending_glines if there aren't any
. param counts should al be correct now


*** 20001225_12 by toot
. fixed some paramcounts in modules
. make GLINE_CLEANUP_TIME a bit more frequent


*** 20001225_11 by wcampbel
Document HUB CAPAB


*** 20001225_10 by wcampbel
Document ISUPPORT


*** 20001225_9 by db
- send on HUB capability if configured as HUB



*** 20001225_8 by wcampbel
1. Updated my TODO list
2. Updated whats-new.txt a little
3. Put a missing space in flame's name
4. Added a summary of the user and channel modes


*** 20001225_7 by db
- I'm convinced. Lets allow remote motd in non shide mode at least
  Its a module, so it can all be changed on the fly anyway.



*** 20001225_6 by db
- sending channel_member_names() to a server is not useful, sending it to the
  client that just joined, might be.



*** 20001225_5 by toot
. made glines and pending_glines into dlink_lists
. couple of minor cleanups/cosmetic changes to m_nick


*** 20001225_4 by db
- motd of non local servers should not be shown to users



*** 20001225_3 by db
- was missing nick in do_numeric in parse.c ... 401 was not
  (no such nick) was not being seen properly by client on LL server.



*** 20001225_2 by db
- ummmm parse isnt' handed a null terminated line, its handed the end of
  of the buffer as well as the start. The end of the buffer if its 
  rfc compliant, will be '\r' '\n' but no terminating '\0'
  so, take bufend look one back that should be a '\n', then blast it
  then look to see if there is a '\r' before it, if so blast it as well
  then thats it... end is now the valid end of the buffer 



*** 20001225_1 by db
- numeric sent to server should be announced what it is ...
- nick change while not on channel would not be propogated to a LL server
  causing those mysterious nick collides. oops.



*** 20001224_23 by db
- extra '\n' in log() not needed



*** 20001224_22 by wcampbel
1. Forgot to change the formatting in oper_only_umodes
2. Add 'rej' '+r' to oper_only_umodes
3. Created a new simple.conf

--snip--
# NOTE TO DEVELOPERS:  Do we set defaults for the variables in the general
#                      block?  If so, then I can leave out most of the things
#                      in here and make it simpler to configure.  If not,
#                      please let me know so I can document things clearly
--end--


*** 20001224_21 by db
- bufend was already there, so use it...



*** 20001224_20 by wcampbel
Add a little more documentation to is-'s oper_only_umodes


*** 20001224_19 by db
- removed unneeded match()
  and removed quite obsolete comments... 
  *sigh* This isn't an historical paper folks, those belong in museums
  not a modern ircd.



*** 20001224_18 by toot
reworded total recieved connections message.  and fixed it in /stats u


*** 20001224_17 by toot
fixed bug that made the date appear twice when klines where written


*** 20001224_16 by adrian


I hate my own grammar.



*** 20001224_15 by toot
SOD IT!!
made tklines into a dlink_list


*** 20001224_14 by adrian


Explain what we're not doing with the poll fd lists ..
Yes, I'll get there after some more feedback.. :-)



*** 20001224_13 by adrian


Stick in an #error in the code - I still haven't finished the poll() code,
so I haven't rewritten the select code ..



*** 20001224_12 by db
- removed lame test that was restarting irc.mcs.net for no reason..
  under heavy ddos the server was being lagged enough to restart..
  No real need for this test.



*** 20001224_11 by db
- remove last remnant of evil #ifdef CHROOT



*** 20001224_10 by adrian


Change some of the comments which aren't applicable now that the old-school
io loop is gone.



*** 20001224_9 by adrian


* move try_connections() into an event, where it should have been a long
  time ago. Its called every TRY_CONNECTIONS_TIME seconds, which right
  now is defined as 60 seconds

* Make most of ioloop() redundant. MMmmmm.. ioloop() looks sexy-slim now..



*** 20001224_8 by toot
. tkline expiry kept crashing.. redid it so it won't
. added VCHANS to 005 numeric


*** 20001224_7 by db
- tidied up isomer's parse.c mods... Then noted that someone was
  sending a numeric to "me" which led to...
- fixing who sends the MODE message in m_mode, it should be sptr->name
  not me.name
- Then noted a conflict in LOGPATH, which I resolved by changing 
  LOGPATH in ircd_parser.y ircd_lexer.l to T_LOGPATH
- removed with extreme prejudice all UID/GID CHROOT crap. my goodness
  efnet servers are dedicated now, and if you really insist, set up a jail
  or something.



*** 20001224_6 by wcampbel
Revised a couple documents


*** 20001224_5 by adrian


Create a LOGPATH which contains the logfile directory, and then
stick ircd.log in there instead of ETCPATH.

What *really* should happen is that these paths and filenames should
be defined in the configuration file, but... :-)



*** 20001224_4 by isomer
* rewrote do_numeric(), it nolonger accepts multiple targets (can't happen)
and hopefully has bugs removed. on the other hand tho, it's only been tested
in that it compiles...





*** 20001224_3 by ejb
- fixed bug whereby a module was not actually dlclose()d in unload_one_module,
  hence trying to reload a module would actually reload the old one
- fixed paramcount in accept
- added mo_version to version_msgtab


*** 20001224_2 by isomer
Changed the way mo_version works with respect to hunt_server



*** 20001224_1 by isomer
oops! forgot about opers!


*** 20001223_57 by wcampbel
Dependencies again....these need either manually done every time someone
changes a header, or automatically done.


*** 20001223_56 by isomer
* added 'show_isupport' and added to m_version (local only).



*** 20001223_55 by ejb

- readd 3rd argument to MYINFO, added it in custom.po as well this time.


*** 20001223_37 by wcampbel
might as well add myself too...


*** 20001223_36 by ejb
- use CAP_HOPS for half-ops


*** 20001223_35 by madmax
All server modes now show as coming from the current server.
This is now whether you are shiding or not - CS has always done it that way 
apparently, so nothing should break.

Fixes for operwall/locops (flame)


*** 20001223_22 by ejb
- fix a stupid core in parse.c.


*** 20001223_21 by ejb
- slightly neater fix for ISON, still has a bug:
  ISON a b :is-
  will still return is- is NOT on because of the :, which
  is blindly copied to the output .. can fix this if its a problem,
  is it likely to be ?


*** 20001223_20 by ejb
- slightly ugly fix to ISON problem committed.  someone might want to take a look
  at the code in parse.c..


*** 20001223_19 by ejb
- noted in whats-news.txt that the old ocnfig format is no longer
  supported.


*** 20001223_18 by madmax
Opers can now see idle times and servernames in whois when shide is on

empty (ie, persistant) vchans use the last person in the channel as
the ID, prefixed with an extra ! ..
so we get
#test has 2 possible virtual channels available
#test !toot !!toot_


*** 20001223_14 by ejb
- add OPER_ONLY_UMODES, umodes which only opers can set.


*** 20001223_13 by wcampbel
1. Make STATS for non-opers consistent...if it's an oper only STATS request,
   then always show ERR_NOPRIVILEGES.
2. Allow STATS x, does the same as X, no reason why it shouldn't
3. I forgot a couple STATS in the opers.txt documentation


*** 20001223_12 by wcampbel
1. Add the broken $$target and $#target to the TODO list
2. Channel Mode +z became +a, update whats-new.txt

. check "if ((x))" in MyFree


*** 20001223_7 by adrian


Update the TODO file with the current state of affairs.



*** 20001223_6 by adrian


Fix 'make distclean' targets in various directories to actually

* not error out when someone types 'make distclean'
* delete Makefile


*** 20001223_5 by db
- added a rough document outlining how remote klines work
  for oper and server protocol.
  I know Walter or Joan can do better, but I think its better than
  nothing no?



*** 20001223_4 by db
- re-added "Ping timeout: nnn seconds" to time out code. 



*** 20001223_3 by db
- client that is notice'ed should not reply with an away.. noticed by Rodder



*** 20001223_2 by db
- fixed stupid bug in m_sjoin.c, lost a sendto_local_channel in the
  rewrite, which meant no MODE's were being sent... I "fixed" it previously
  in the wrong way, which resulted in weird five mode ops etc.



*** 20001223_1 by toot
. removed that pointless s_conf.h log
. changed +z to +a.. it's anonymous ops ;)
. "is now an operator.." notice doesn't need to show if they are global/local now
. slight fix to example.conf


*** 20001222_15 by db
- moved obsolete conf file examples into old
  purely for historical reasons



*** 20001222_14 by db
- simplified conf handling for yacc



*** 20001222_13 by db
- converted all use of IsGlobalOper and IsLocalOper to IsOper
  there is no local oper now



*** 20001222_12 by db
- removing local oper references, removing bloat...



*** 20001222_11 by db
- Ok, ALL the old support for old style confs is gone now, except for K/D lines
  That means IF YOU HAVEN'T CONVERTED FORMAT YET, DO IT NOW,
  OR IT WILL NOT RUN. capiche?
  I'll be able to simplify the parser in a bit a little more.



*** 20001222_10 by db
- ok. attach_cn_lines() was just plain wrong.
  The code was matching on hostname(ip) instead of servername
  One needs to look up by servername, then check if the hostname/ip matches..
  This explains why I had problem with multi servers on same host but different
  names.

  I think I got this right... but I am NOT sure if it works for hostmasked
  servers properly. that has to be verified asap. Might need a match()
  in the code.. 




*** 20001222_9 by wcampbel
1. Cleaned up a comment and trailing blank lines from m_oper.c
2. Added an md5 based mkpasswd.c, which works on FreeBSD 3.x/4.x and Linux
   glibc.  Known NOT to work on Solaris 2.6 and Cygwin.

1. Added an example of user and host in the shared section
2. Updated opers.txt some more
3. Added OMOTD to the REHASH help message
4. STATS P shouldn't show to non-opers


*** 20001222_7 by db
- tiny bug fix for logging



*** 20001222_6 by db
- massive addition to add extra parameter to struct Message
  this will enable us to have the parser handle parameter counts
  properly in all cases before it even gets to the module it is calling.



*** 20001222_5 by db
- use irccmp() not match in m_kline for "ON" parser duh
- use irccmp() not strncasecmp in m_set.c
- slight fix for stupid memory leak in class.c found by einride

*** 20001222_1 by db
- modifed m_kline to add directed klines

  All the following should work

kline directed at a specific server
  /quote kline user@host ON server :reason 
  /quote kline [time] user@host on server :reason

kline directed at all servers
  /quote kline user@host on * :reason

original normal local klines

  /quote kline user@host :reason
  /quote kline [time] user@host :reason

Brought convertconf up to date.  It now produces a valid -7 conf.
Anyone mind if I add some more test lines to the test ircd.conf in tools?


*** 20001221_17 by db
- non opers should not be able to do /stats ?



*** 20001221_16 by db
- removed local opers, its obsolete with oper flags besides
  users can probe which server an oper is on...



*** 20001221_15 by wcampbel
Removed global from example.conf as local opers no longer exist.
Added a "What's New" document giving a brief overview of the new Hybrid 
 featues.

- updated blalloc.c from einride



*** 20001221_6 by adrian


XXX UNTESTED UNTESTED UNTESTED UNTESTED

(Go a broken CVS tree. :-)

* change HANDLED_OK to CLIENT_OK. God knows why the two return values from
  parse_client_queued() (at least from ircd_defs.h) turned out to be
  CLIENT_EXITED or HANDLED_OK. Lets hear three cheers for great coding!

* Changed parsed_client_queued() to return CLIENT_OK if everythign went well
  (it was returning a numerical value..)

* Actually listen to the return values of parse_client_queued() in
  determining whether to schedule antoher comm_setselect() or
  reregister the client in the flush list.

A bug was found where a fd was being thrown onto the flush list in
flood_recalc() which would then trigger an assertion. This won't call
comm_setflush() if the client has just exited.

What *should* happen in comm_checktimeouts() is there should be an
assertion that the fd is open (flags.open) before calling the handler..
just to be anal.



*** 20001221_5 by db
- missing m_dmem.c file from einride



*** 20001221_4 by db
- missing memdebug.c from einride



*** 20001221_3 by db
- added missing memdebug.h passed on by einride



*** 20001221_2 by db
- added einride's memory debugging



*** 20001221_1 by db
- the modes not propagating on sjoin was my fault. 
  channel_modes() set the +ntz in modebuf, which I then promptly
  walked over... one has to leave those modes in then add the +o and +v



*** 20001220_28 by db
- cleanups



*** 20001220_27 by ejb
- some more +z stuff.


*** 20001220_26 by db

- fixed m_sjoin() for +Z



*** 20001220_23 by wcampbel
Added a couple things to the bottom


*** 20001220_22 by ejb
- make ms_sjoin notice +z



*** 20001220_21 by ryan
write_log now is sure that logfile is not NULL and that the buffer
isn't overflowed (sprintf -> snprintf)


*** 20001220_20 by db
- added sendto_realops on gline (flame)
- capitalized "ping timeout" to "Ping timeout"
 


*** 20001220_19 by ejb
 -made +z work properly


*** 20001220_18 by ejb

*** 20001220_17 by ejb
- removed hide_chanops from config since its not used anymore.



*** 20001220_16 by ejb
- added umode +z, hides ops on channel (replaces hide_chanops=yes)
- changed format of 004 numeric



*** 20001220_15 by wcampbel
example.conf is now correct for the current state of the parser.
All that is needed now is more documentation on the options


*** 20001220_14 by db
- patched m_gline.c from fl_
- patched ircd_parser from Walter Campbell



*** 20001220_13 by ejb
- added note about using `send-pr' to report bugs
- added note that cygwin is no longer support.


*** 20001220_12 by ejb
added GNATS support for ircd.
currently using a gnats db hosted on leguin.org.uk, can be changed
if needed.



*** 20001220_11 by ejb
Directory /cvsroot/ircd-hybrid-7/gnats added to the repository


*** 20001220_10 by db
- added notification to target when put on and taken off accept list



*** 20001220_9 by db
- fixed wallops so it doesn't add the "WALLOPS" message, uneeded.
- updated INSTALL and CIDR docs from Walter Campbell



*** 20001220_8 by db
- fixed stupid in m_wallops.c it was not showing oper wallops but was
  showing server wallops



*** 20001220_7 by db
- shared {} can now have user/host for user@host of oper allowed
  to place a remote kline from server given by name.

- updated the lazy link docs a bit, its badly written, fix.



*** 20001220_6 by db
- I hate furry logic when I'm tired. 



*** 20001220_5 by db
- TOPIC_UH is =gone= but was still in parser/lexer and m_topic.c
  removed. Also added code to hide the always present topic u@h
  if chide is on.



*** 20001220_4 by db
- I had interchanged name/host oops



*** 20001220_3 by cosine
connect timeout problem fixed


*** 20001220_2 by db
- fixed convertconf to bring it in line with current conf file format
  it does a reasonable first pass job, though you still might need to
  tweak..

- We were missing "shared" keyword in new conf file. This is vaguely worded
  to allow us to support "shared klines" "shared locops" etc. should
  we choose to do so... If I had time, I would extend it to allow
  specification of remote user@host as well... and whether it applies
  to klines/locops/unkline etc. shared resources...

- provided I hear back from adrian after a successful conversion of
  his conf file, I'm going to nuke most of the gook in oldparser.c
  so it only deals with 'D' and 'K' lines.. I'll likely rename it as well
  kdparser.c maybe..

- parse.c has a bug. but its late for me, I'll look at it after some sleep
  maybe is- and I can look at it together. The problem is simple...

ISON nick1 nick2 nick3...... nick20

all nicks at 15 to 20 should go into the last parv[]
not be truncated... at a space. Otherwise we break ISON for sure, and
likely other things...

- Adrian can you move logs into /logs from /etc ? pretty please? ;)

 


*** 20001220_1 by db
- don't send on a nick change if the nick hasnt' been seen on a lazy
  link server...



*** 20001219_11 by db
- fixed double free in invites
- fixed prefix botch in m_invite() using sendto_anywhere()
  but adding a prefix myself. oops. sendto_anywhere does its own prefixes.

in ircdauth.c

  It won't compile like that

- This looks like it works finally .... lazylinks

- removed no longer used option in example.conf
 



*** 20001219_9 by cosine
iauth is now working again


*** 20001219_8 by db
- lazylinks final form. New nicks introduced after the burst, are
  simply passed on. The reason is simple. SJOIN would have to be modifed
  to pass new nicks onto ll servers, and its a pita. SJOIN needs more
  rewriting before I attempt that. ugh. So for now, any new nicks that
  join the network, get propogated to the LL leaf as normal. The hub
  does not burst nicks at all, it bursts channel back ON request of 
  a cburst from the ll server, as it does so, it SJOIN's the nicks needed
  as well as SJOINing the channels requested. Nicks that are on the server
  but not sjoin'ed to a channel, will be propogated to the LL leaf
  when they join a channel, not before. i.e. if you are nick A on 
  hub HUBA you will not be nick propogated to the leaf until you join
  a channel, or you /quit and rejoin the network. Simple?
  Capiche?



*** 20001219_7 by ejb
- made modlist return a numeric
- put ms_quit back in (oops).


*** 20001219_6 by ejb
- added client_exit:
   *** Signoff: foo (Client Exit: foo)
- removed ms_quit.



*** 20001219_5 by db
- removed goto in channel.c dealing with invex



*** 20001219_4 by db
- This completes most of the full LL nick implementation...
  nicks unknown to a leaf LL must not have information sent to that LL
  only when introduced i.e. when they JOIN a channel or are /whois'ed
  /who'ed etc. are burst onto the LL leaf. 
  a /msg to a nick that only exists on the hub will fail ATM since
  m_message.c is not set up to burst the target nick onto the LL leaf.
  However, doing a /whois of the target first, will make the nick
  available. It will be simple to finish this part.. But after I get some
  sleep. 



*** 20001219_3 by db
- show the name of the server sending a CBURST if its not LL



*** 20001219_2 by db
- nick LL are almost there...
  Now, nick changes for nicks that the hub does not know about on a leaf
  ll server are not sent on to that leaf.
  This still means a /msg nick where nick is not known yet
  will fail, but a /whois will "burst" that nick onto the ll server...
  So, privmsg/notify should do a nick burst... ditto on ison
  Basically what now happens is, the ll server begins to become "aware"
  of nicks it needs to know about, just not all of them unless it asks
  the uplink...



*** 20001219_1 by ejb
- make invex code actually work.



*** 20001218_7 by db
- modifed lazylinks partially, to not send a full nick burst..
  still some work to do on this..
- added client_burst_if_needed() ... it checks to see if the given
  server pointer is a server, is a lazylink, and if it does not
  know about that given client, it bursts the nick.
- A nick that is not known on a leaf, will be nick collided ! if it
  changes nick. Thats next folks.. removing the sending of nick
  changes to leafs that don't know about that nick.
  


*** 20001218_6 by ejb
- remove whois_notice stupidity
- +a umode is now set automatically for admin=yes; opers, and cannot be changed.



*** 20001218_5 by db
- ok. redid the way the bitmaps were cleared for lazylinks.
  the old code walked all the global channels, clearing the
  lazyLinkChannelExists bitmap of the leaf servers bit.. Now the code
  keeps track of which channels/clients have these bits set, and only
  walks those lists when a lazy link server quits.
  This adds new lists to ircd.c, new bitmap to client struct, new call
  in m_cburst.c .. client.c modded to call remove_lazyLink_flags()
  new code added in s_serv.c to add remove_lazylink_flags() and to add
  add_lazylinkchannel() and add_lazylinkclient() functions to s_serv.c



*** 20001218_4 by bill

- removed compile-time warnings caused by fbputs()


*** 20001218_3 by db
- still more cleanups
- removed superflous sjoin code, it was already done by send_channel_modes
  duh.



*** 20001218_2 by bill

- forgot to remove a conflict


*** 20001218_1 by bill

- changed all file_open() and file_close() calls to fbopen() and fbclose()
- changed all write()s to fbputs()s
- updated dependancy file
- added strerror() msgs to failed file i/o logs/server notices
- moved FBFILE struct from fileio.c to fileio.h


*** 20001217_9 by db
- rewrote m_gline.c to use fbopen and friends consistently
  removed "safe_write()" entirely. BLOAT



*** 20001217_8 by db
- massive change but its really quite simple..
  mod_add_cmd was taking two params, when only one was really necessary.
  first was command name, second was the Message entry.. the command
  is available from msg->cmd, so why duplicate it? lead to errors
  ditto on mod_del_cmd()
  sooooo all modules had to be rewritten for this new world order...

- Also cleaned up a lot of missing definitions for functions..



*** 20001217_7 by cosine
just to get things compiling again


*** 20001217_6 by db
- added global uplink cptr valid for leafs ONLY



*** 20001217_5 by db
- added vhost support, should work now
  in doing, removed an extern not needed any more in s_bsd_kqueue.c
  s_bsd_poll.c and s_bsd_select.c... thats when I noticed... local[]

- first crack at cleaning up s_bsd_select.c so it will compile. I just
  removed local[] from it for now, the rest is adrian's MUAHHAHAHH!
  It still won't compile, but ... its a start



*** 20001217_4 by bill

- added _k9_ (jeremy, wowsers.) to credits as a contributer


*** 20001217_3 by db
- I ran it through lint, discovered a pile of unused variables unused
  parameters. Removed... and made a function static in channel.c
- added einride and hwy to credits, give them some vanity.
- fileio.c had an obvious bug, but we never used fbgetc() so it didn't 
  matter. pro is going to look at the ircu version, to see if we can
  fold that one back in without issues.



*** 20001217_2 by db
- removed the two pass exit procedure in check_klines check_pings
  it was =only= done in the first place to get around the local[] 
  re-arrangement nonsense in the original code. This is long gone..



*** 20001217_1 by db
- moved gline expiration to be an event started from ircd.c at startup
  right now its run every half hour. That should be sufficient.

- also cleanedup s_gline.c s_gline.h m_gline.c while at it. Removed
  unnecessary and obsolete extern definitions. Made a couple of functions
  static. Found a duplicate definition for glines in s_conf.c!

- Fixed LazyLink join to a non existing channel on the hub. The 
  hub has to actually create the channel but not SJOIN it to anything.
  Then the hub can mark this channel as a lazy link channel with the leaf
  being "interested" in knowing about the channel. The timestamp should be
  set to the highest possible time, so its always overruled. It also
  should be expired if necessary.i.e. lazy link server dies after doing
  cburst request but before received LLJOIN.
  Removed the useless lazylink references in m_join.c duh. 



*** 20001216_9 by db
- fixed join 0 grrrr
- m_lljoin should give member names when joining
- lazy links flag should be set when joining
 


*** 20001216_8 by db
- lazy link lljoin was relying on can_join which needed to be moved into
  channel.c from m_join.c
- applied einrides conf changes, which will remove the original I line
  conf from an oper replacing it with the new one.



*** 20001216_7 by db
- ok did some more clean up on LazyLinks connect works fine more or less
  The nicks are SJOIN'ed one nick at a time to the leaf, That should be
  fixed.
- new channel creation has a glitch somewhere, the LLJOIn isn't
  being seen by the client, and it has to do a double join. hrmmmpf



*** 20001216_6 by db
- remote lazy link /list was broken, missing ms_link in handler



*** 20001216_5 by db
        Included here is a patch which adds the function strip_tabs
        to irc_string.c; the function converts all found tabs to
        spaces, while copying the string.

        The reason I wrote this is because in h7, when HUPd or
        /REHASHd, the server will show opers any bad lines it
        finds in ircd.conf.  Most of these lines start with tab,
        so, displaying the actual tab character is irritating for
        users who use something other than an ircii derivative.

        It applies to ircd-hybrid-7-20001216-103810.tar.gz, which
        adrian gave me this morning.  I tested it, and it's being
        used on hybrid.best.net's test H7 server.

        Another function which might be useful would be one which
        squeezes excessive whitespace into just one space itself
        (eg. tr/ / /s (or "     " --> " ")).

- fixed lazy links. I was trying to use the extended "join new nick
  to network" SJOIN instead of the simpler "join this nick to channel" SJOIN
  oops. That would collide everyone. Sooo that involved a pile of 
  fixes and new functions to properly send SJOIN channel. Might be able
  to simplify reduce recyle functions later...

- Oh documented a few more globals in ircd.c and ircd.h, also removed
  a couple of references to no longer existing variables.. LRV etc.

  Its poorly documented in the old sources... ick... sendto_common_channel
  says its not supposed to send to the originator, but yet it does ...
  *sigh*



*** 20001213_10 by db
- when msgtab went away, due to the hash table replacement,
  m_stats.c, m_help.c had to be rewritten. I had to add a new 
  report command in parse. I stumbled across an apparent compiler bug..
  the hash table is defined to be 387 entries, but the report function
  was walking in to the poll fd lists at 385... Something is screwy here
  perhaps a rounding error? In any case, thats why the weird +10 
  in parse.c msg_hash_table[MAX_MSG_HASH+10];



*** 20001213_9 by db

  but a few clear dependancies such as m_stats depending on stuff loaded
  only by m_gline ... sooo moved much of that in s_gline.c since
  s_conf.c is quite large enough thankyou.
- also redid m_invite.c so it will show the right channel name on an 
  invite to a vchan. removed the silly message to channel stuff on invites,
  it was referring to a no longer defined function anyway... BLOAT
  totally removed the need to be chanop before sending an invite, hence
  modified the lexer/parser to remove that option totally BLOAT
  removed the need to be +i before adding the invite block. who cares.

OH WHAT A BLASTED PITA
- Ok... a CONNECTING server must put the server its trying to connect to
  on the serv_list because its going to blindly send its server burst
  to its new uplink. But the server its connecting to is not strictly
  a server yet until the handshake is over ... oy
  SO, the connecting to server is put on the serv_list, so the connect
  burst will go through, but it might not be a server yet if the connection
  fails, so... I have to check on the server list as well as the unregisterd
  list to pull it off (in exit_client/client.c).. ugh ugh ugh...
- This breaks all the state information in ->state ugh. 
  A leaf server has a client (the one its connecting to) already in its
  serv_list (remember?) sooo it can no longer simply check for a non
  empty serv_list to allow a connection or not. NOOOO it now has to make
  sure that server in that list is the same one its trying to connect to.
  (in serv_establish/s_serv.c) UGH UGH UGH

Do build magick in the binary. Now, --prefix="foo" is reflected in DPATH
and is also reflected in the various PATH's there are.

The handling of the ETCDIR stuff is ugly and warrants instant death in
my eyes, but it works and it doesn't cause me to retch when I look at it
so I guess it can stay there until Someone Else(tm) fixes it.

Note that IRCD_PREFIX needs to be defined during the ircd and tools build.
I *did* try doing the squid thing - take config.h, pass a sed script over
it to map DPATH to @prefix@, and do it that way, but it might have made some
people throw up.

This completes tonights set of work which I just shouldn't have done.
Comments can be piped through cvs commit.




*** 20001212_7 by adrian


The very first step in sanifying the make and install process

* move opers.txt into doc like it bloody should have been
* make install work with each subdir's Makefile rules, rather than
  install_ircd
* create placeholders (blank) for ircd.motd and kline.conf

Its all far too complex to explain. Suffice to say, its neater.
Binaries and some of the config files (not the kline, motd) are
renamed to .old as a backup.

Now, do the binary ..



*** 20001212_6 by db
- folded in Walter Campbell's IPV6 patches



*** 20001212_5 by db
- verified the generated prefixes on a number of files
- umm the big bug was in serv_connect_callback() the newly connected =to=
  server was not being put on the serv_list... This mean that SJOIN's were
  not being propogated to a =connected to= server since the connectee
  had no idea it was supposed to.

  This was sorta obvious when /stats v returned 0 servers, and the 
  serv_list was 0

- not sure if I am closing all the fd's that should be closed here..
  the original code refers to connecting servers as well as unknown_clients
  perhaps connecting server fd's should be also closed?



*** 20001211_13 by db
- a client being made into a server, should be removed from the unknown_list
  this was happening in the new server establish code...
  This left an unknown client hanging around, not removed from unknown_list
  because it was now a server, not an unknown client.

- local removal was missed in m_stats.c, this meant /stats didn't work
  since it was never loaded. There are three other functions that have
  to be fixed as well... m_trace.c, m_die.c, m_close.c



*** 20001211_12 by db
- tiny comment fix in check_pings



*** 20001211_11 by db
- how did THAT get back in. removed local[] again *sigh*



*** 20001211_10 by db
- simple re-work to m_ison.c, rfc1489 is ambigious about how this should
  be handled...

The ISON command was implemented to provide  a  quick  and  efficient
   means  to get a response about whether a given nickname was currently
   on IRC. ISON only takes one (1) parameter: a space-separated list of
   nicks.  For  each  nickname in the list that is present, the server
   adds that to its reply string.  Thus the reply string may return
   empty (none  of  the given  nicks are present), an exact copy of the
   parameter string (all of them present) or as any other subset of the
   set of nicks  given  in  the parameter.  The only limit on the number
   of nicks that may be checked is that the combined length must not be
   too large as to cause the server to chop it off so it fits in 512
   characters.
...
   Examples:

   ISON phone trillian WiZ jarlek Avalon Angel Monstah
                                   ; Sample ISON request for 7 nicks.

...
  But the parser will break those up into parv[1] ......

  And the parser only presently handles 8 .. so Monstah wouldn't be parsed...
oops.

  Mirc apparently sends them "ISON nick1 nick2 nick3"
  But other clients must be sending them with a ':' to force parsing
of space separated nicks into one parv[1] (?)

  It appears that thats how hybrid-5 expects it. It has to come in as
"ISON : nick1 nick2 nick3" to force "nick1 nick2 nick3" into parv[1] !

  In any case, this code =should= handle both interpretations.  



*** 20001211_9 by db
- removed the last remnant of local[], was one hidden in s_serv.c
  the definition for it was hiding in s_bsd.c



*** 20001211_8 by db
- renamed send_channel_members to sendto_list_anywhere, to remain consistent
  in send.c with sendto_list_local. This really means we =could= set up
  the "GROUP" idea Roger postulated ages ago... Roger suggested something
  like this "NGROUP foo" "GROUP foo nick1,nick2,nick3" privmsg to 
  foo, sends to nick1,nick2,nick3 ... I suppose foo would have to have 
  disambiguitating prefix like $ so one could set up a group of users
  you wanted to talk to often..

- fixed s_stats.c to be consistent in only needing the client pointer
  passed, not both a client pointer and a nick.

- reverted to old CC options in modules -g -O2 etc.

*** 20001211_6 by db
- unknown clients should be removed from the unknown_list on exit!

*** 20001211_5 by db
- this gets rid of local[] 
  unknown clients are now placed into unknown_list, moved to
  serv_list (local servers only) and lclient_list (local client list)
  as appropriate. check_pings now scans the lclient_list, serv_list
  and then checks for unknown clients timing them out as appropriate.
  Now, the proper place to do PING checks is in s_bsd.c in
  comm_checktimeouts() using a timeout_handler (as pointed out by Adrian)
  ... Someone will have to check that unknown clients
  are also on this list, and get rid of that fixed sized fd_table...

- Seems I screwed up the inter-server NICK prefix and message , this
  caused all sorts of neat nick collides.

  functionality borrowed from dalnet/ircnet?

Pending BUGS;
  - /msg $#hostmask is still broken across servers
  - /squit of a remote server appears to be broken

Pending re-work:
  - check_pings()/check_kline() should be reworked so as not to use a
    fixed size array...



*** 20001210_12 by db
- This fixes prefix on a nick change sent to local server.



*** 20001210_11 by db
- fixed length error in sendto_realops_flags



*** 20001210_10 by db
- re-wrote send_operwall, renamed as sendto_all_local_opers()
  this necessitated changes to send.c send.h send.txt
  m_connect.c m_locops.c m_operwall.c m_squit.c m_wallops.c
- cleaned up check_string() in ircd.c added more comments



*** 20001210_9 by db
- updated docs in send.txt
- fixed parser as per walter campbells patch



*** 20001210_8 by db
- cleaned up m_gline.c, STILL untested.
- removed unnecessary lines in ircd_parser.y due to removed botcheck
- only show stats 'G' to opers
- updated opers.txt, client.c to show leaving servers as well as 
  being introduced servers.
- cleanup_channels() wasn't being restarted when server was a hub,
  it should be always run now, to expire persistent channels.



*** 20001210_7 by db
- missed a place where send_trim() should have been used



*** 20001210_6 by db
- as promised, tidied up send.c added to send.txt document



*** 20001210_5 by db
- went through and removed a bunch of unused variables
- fixed sendto_channel_butone, need to generate both local and remote
  prefixes in this one. The function will need tidying up later.
- updated send.txt to include info on prefixes.



*** 20001210_4 by db
- Was missing proper prefix for normal privmsg to local channel



*** 20001210_3 by db
- removed last remnant of oratime



*** 20001210_2 by db
- new text file describing the send.c re-work.



*** 20001210_1 by db
- sendto_prefix_one is =gone=
- sendto_one should be used for local clients only, with prefix
  pre-built at time of use.
- sendto_anywhere is a somewhat saner replacement for sendto_prefix_one 
  (I think) it should be used ONLY when target client is unknown whether
  its local or remote, it will build the appropriate prefix itself in 
  that case. This makes it less efficient than sendto_one..
- I kludged send_message_remote() for now... adrian you might want
  to look at that... maybe we can get away with just always calling
  send_message() or add a short common function or something...
  send_message() should be for local clients (not servers(? only(?)
  perhaps i.e. send_message_local() and send_message_remote()
  sendto_one should be renamed sendto_local() (sendto_local_client)
  sendto_remote (sendto_remote_client) sendto_anywhere() sends to either...
  Too tired right now..

BUGS pending...
1) the horrid /msg $#host.mask to clients on remote servers is =broken= for now.
   (it works locally)
2) sendto @# chanop style messages is =broken= to remote servers for now.
3) Probably more *yawn* 
  


*** 20001209_17 by db
- oops, the missing .depend files



*** 20001209_16 by db
- rewrote sendto_realops in doing so I decided to combine sendto_realops_flags
  and sendto_realops()... I could have macro'ed sendto_realops() to
  call "sendto_realops_flags(FLAGS_ALL..." but that level of obsfuscuation
  I don't like.. soooooo I converted all sendto_realops to use
  sendto_realops_flags(FLAGS_ALL ... *fun*
- I removed two unused files for now, one to do with ZIPLINKS one
  to do with timings.. it wasn't used, thats what CVS tree is for, so there.



*** 20001209_15 by db
- removed little used function... will have to replace functionality
  for remote send of KNOCK and msg @#channel code...



*** 20001209_14 by db
- I was using ->user instead of ->username in prefix. *DUH*
- removed pretty much identical function in send.c (MORE BLOAT GONE!)
  using another function to do the same job. (sendto_list())



*** 20001209_13 by db
- ok. in the new world order... prefixes are generated at the top level
  instead of being grunged out in send.c... This gets rid of incredible
  idiotic connipations that were happening in send.c... I've only done 
  this for =LOCAL= sent to server messages so far, hence ALL uses of
  sendto_channel_local you must work out your own prefix. Its not hard,
  and is worth the bother. This modified a bunch of modules.

- I have also preformatted the stupid string to be sent to each client
  in sendto_channel_local AT the top instead of re-formatting it each
  and every time a message is sent to a client. like *duh*



*** 20001209_12 by db
- quick fix to fix prefixes on LOCAL channels only...
  prefix adding was =hidden= in underlying send.c functions. 
  NOT a good idea IMO.. this makes its harder to optimize code...
  fughly anyway, I think I got the major prefixes fixed for now.. 



*** 20001209_11 by db

*** 20001209_10 by bill

- added duration to EOB snotice


*** 20001209_9 by db
- rationalized use of serial numbers for unique sending to client
  this removes yet another array "sentalong" yay.
  This also makes server_burst use the same serial # idea instead of
  nickissent byte flag.
- I note that prefixes really should be sent for local channel JOIN's
  ooops. sendto_prefix is =fugly= though. lemme think about it.
  meanwhile, all JOIN's by remote clients look "weird" as they are
  missing their user@host prefixes...



*** 20001209_8 by bill

- removed bloat from client struct, no longer being used pointers removed.



*** 20001209_5 by db

- fixed stupid in m_sjoin, you can have more than 4 ops/nicks per sjoin *oops*



*** 20001208_17 by db
- m_who is less broken for single nick who, but it looks broken to me
  still... checked on efnet, it looks broken.



*** 20001208_16 by db
- added m_eob to modules, this means changes to handlers.h, msg.h, Makefile.in
- also had to modify s_serv.c to send EOB message
- fixed stupid typo in m_admin.c, it was claiming to be m_version.c



*** 20001208_15 by db
- sped up local op code...



*** 20001208_14 by db
- sped up m_sjoin.c somewhat... also fixed a bug where the code
  would relink the same vchan over and over again to the root. oops.
  This resulted in 277 #ircd-coders !nympho !shig !shig !shig !shig !shig !shig !shig !shig

  vchan on remote servers due to the wrong name being passed to the SJOIN



*** 20001208_7 by toot
gline_file isn't used anywhere.  and it was also the one
making the '1 rule not reduced' error :)

- quick #ifdef of excess flood for tonight. its late
- redid send_modelist
- channels that exist for less than 30 minutes are not persistent
- redid m_sjoin



*** 20001207_17 by adrian


* add bufhead->numlines and linebuf_numlines() - this implements line count
  tracking so you can see how many lines are being used (complete/incomplete)
  in the linebuf. Now people can implement linecount flooding.

* update bufhead->len correctly. It was being done in linebuf_flush() but
  not linebuf_get() which meant that the recvq would grow, and the flood
  protection (which used linebuf_line() rather than linebuf_allocline()
  until about 5 minutes ago) would eventually kick off a user.

  Now the tracking is done in linebuf_done_line() where it should have been
  all along. Honestly, the crack I must've been smoking then ..



*** 20001207_16 by db
- fixed example.conf connect example



*** 20001207_15 by db
- removed botcheck which is obsolete, this gets rid of the one rule
  never reduced error in the parser...
- updated the example.conf to include server links, important that..



*** 20001207_14 by adrian


Use linebuf_alloclen() rather than linebuf_len() for flood tracking.
This should be done anyway, to stop people taking up inordinate amounts of
memory by flooding lines with only a few characters, which can be just
as annoying.



*** 20001207_13 by db
- non op trying to set a channel limit should get a not chanop message



*** 20001207_12 by db
- fixed two bugs. one bug in m_join.c prevented JOIN 0 from being 
  detected.
- second bug was one I introduced into send.c when I added lazylinks
  I put a test for a NULL chptr into the wrong spot... This probably
  affected other commands then just JOIN 0...



*** 20001207_11 by db
- class is a string not an int now (testline)
- redid m_sjoin... erg we are going to have to do some serious sanity
  checking on send.c sendto_channel_butserv tries to be "helpful"
  and uses vsendto_prefix_one() which promptly tries to put the
  proper prefix on the string. ugh. I already KNOW what prefix I want
  I don't need this overhead. time to re-examine asap



*** 20001207_10 by db
- fixed stupid in channel.c with ban sending... used banptr forgot
  the ->banstr oops.
- removed totally unused variable in s_user.c LastWallopsTime...
  wallops is no longer paced. rah rah.



*** 20001207_9 by db
- first cut at cleaning up m_gline.c its still fugly... but cleaner
- added CAP_GLN for capable of gline servers. I didn't realize this
  wasn't here before. ugh.



*** 20001207_8 by db
- fixed m_stats.c so /stats E,F as non oper gives No permission error



*** 20001207_7 by db
- m_message.c would core if the channel was +m and you tried to
  message it. duh



*** 20001207_6 by db
- missing parc test in m_knock.c caused it to core on knock with 
  no args. spotted by poptix...



*** 20001207_5 by db
- missed committing new conf file because I forgot to rename it from
  ircd.conf to example.conf grrr



*** 20001207_4 by db
- Like a surgeon who leaves a scalpel inside a patient, I left some
  debugging code inside m_names.c ... some extra sendto_realops...
  *blush* at least the patient hasn't died ...



*** 20001207_3 by db
- added example of new style conf file (finally)
- renamed old ircd.conf example as ircd_old.conf



*** 20001207_2 by db
- fixed m_sjoin.c for vchans finally. They work just fine now.



*** 20001207_1 by db
- fixed obvious bug in sjoin code for vchannels. its still broken
  for remote joins, but getting there.
- allow halfops to +imtsp channels like full ops



*** 20001206_13 by db
- reverted previous m_kline.c change in favour of...
- letting s_conf.c figure out if the oper placing the kline is remote oper
  or not, and logging it appropriately.



*** 20001206_12 by db
- cleaned up m_server.c some more. ugh. it was horrid



*** 20001206_11 by db
- riedel's patch to keep from adding nicks twice to an accept list



*** 20001206_10 by db
- redoing RPL_VCHANLIST so last %s is gone, since I'm building
  up the channel sublist myself



*** 20001206_9 by db
- m_accept was using the wrong numeric for "no such nick"



*** 20001206_8 by db
- ummm there is a bug where an struct Confitem aconf will have a NULL
  c_class (pointer to class) this will core the server in attach_iline
  this should be fixed, meanwhile... validate the pointer is non NULL
  before trying to dereference it for now.



*** 20001206_7 by db
- transposed user/host in m_kline.c



*** 20001206_6 by db
- m_capab.c was missing an MFLG_UNREG hence was never being called
  in some cases. oops



*** 20001206_5 by db
- cleaned up m_server.c, removed some redundant code



*** 20001206_4 by db
- "CAP_KLN" string was missing in s_serv.c



*** 20001206_3 by db
- added mr_capab to handlers.h 
- changed m_capab to use mr_capab, remember capabilities are sent
  while client is still unregistered
- fixed another parser bug pointed out by Walter Campbell
- added sanity test to del_all_accepts



*** 20001206_2 by db
- reworked anti channel flooding to allow chanops/voice to flood
  their own channel with impunity. This will allow them to at least
  set +m if the channel really is flooded!
- fixed parser error spotted by Walter Campbel (Hwy101)



*** 20001206_1 by db
- on_accept_list can be on a remote client, having it on the localClient
  part will lead to a core..
- hacked out a portion of adrian's flood control for now.. to get
  the darn thing to do a server link. I'll look at it in the morning
  when I am awake.



*** 20001205_10 by db
- updated TODO
- c lines were blasted when ZIPLINKS were removed, put them back
  as normal C lines for now
- up check ping event time to 30 seconds
- close fbfile after parsing in .include
- check for NULL find on strchr('\n') in initconf



*** 20001205_9 by db
- moved check for flood attack on channel after check can_send
  


*** 20001205_8 by db
- ok, added channel throttling tested both channel throttling and message
  throttling, both appear to work. Removed FLOODTIME, default to always
  one second for now. 



*** 20001205_7 by db
- redid m_set.c precalculate newval etc.



*** 20001205_6 by db
- committed Jeremy Chadwicks (best.net) m_set table driven code
- sprinkled some asserts into linebuf.c
- fixed typo in m_admin.c



*** 20001205_5 by db
- cleaned up class.c adding more comment blocks
- cleaned up s_conf.c to actually use nice defines instead of cryptic #'s
- fixed typo in linebuf.c



*** 20001205_4 by toot
removed zlib from configure, and updated version number


*** 20001205_3 by db
- updated opers.txt for h7, its more or less right now
- added new 'u' flag for opers, show unauth clients on that flag instead
  of 'c' flag
- moved 'u' flag to 'g' for CALLERID
- upped flooding parms slightly some more... still set too low I think
- changed DRONE_FLOOD etc. to plain FLOOD... This is generic anti
  flooding code for the =recipient=



*** 20001205_2 by db
- cleaned up these functions, two arguments when 1 is quite enough
  this makes them consistent with other functions that only pass
  the struct Client *sptr. No need to also pass the nick.
- changed wording on vchan's at toyota's suggestion.



*** 20001205_1 by db
- added rest of accept code.
  client puts themselves into +u mode, this disallows casual messages
  to that client. The source gets a "am on server side ignore" from the
  target, the target gets a message saying source has messaged them, 
  but paced to once a minute.
  a client in +u mode (or any other mode actually) can add clients
  it will accept messages from using /quote accept nick
  delete them using /quote accept -nick (perhaps /quote delete nick would
  make more sense?) a list with /quote accept *



*** 20001204_17 by db
- found the cause of the blalloc bit already cleared error..
  dlink_node was already been cleared in remove_user_from_channel
  exit_one_client was trying to also free it.
- added sendto_cap_serv_butone for sending to capable servers
  added rudimentary remote kline code to use this. NOT TESTED
  until I get a remote server up.



*** 20001204_16 by db
- removed duplicate function from m_kline.c replaced with function
  already in place but unused in s_conf.c duh. can we say BLOAT?



*** 20001204_15 by db
- fixed bug in parse_client_queued to do with opered clients.
  code was nver resetting lcptr->sent_parsed = 0 and actually_read = 0
  so poor oper would no longer be listened to after a while...
  Replaced goto with a if (!IsPrivileged... macro... 
- removed last remnants of USER_UH defines ... GONE



*** 20001204_14 by db
- don't devoice/voice if chanop



*** 20001204_13 by db
- identity of who set a ban should be hidden in channel op hide mode



*** 20001204_12 by db
- empty vchans shown on list have no clients to key off of,
  return a timestamp for now. You can't join them still since 
  the join code doesnt' know anything about joining on a ts key.



*** 20001204_11 by db
- class.c get_client_class returns a string class name now
  It was trying to use a struct ConfItem as a class pointer. oops.
  As conf's now have a pointer to the class name anyway, its easier
  to pull it from the conf anyway. If its NULL, return 'default'
  string for now.



*** 20001204_10 by db
- lost a 433 (nickname in use error) somewhere in the way,
  put it back in.. m_nick.c



*** 20001204_9 by db
- had logic wrong in can_send



*** 20001204_8 by db
This is a patch which implements client send flood protection.
This is the type of flood where someone goes

/join #foo
/exec -o cat bigfile.txt

and they quit with "Excess Flood"  .

Note that if a client floods, its allow_read value will decrease. If they then
stop flooding, their allow_read value will increase regardless of whether
there is any pending data .. this flushes the output quicker if and only
if they stop flooding.

I've managed to cause this thing to go tits up a few ways when having
a client flooding a channel and it gets killed:

* a blfree bitmap error. Diane, Can you please check out why ? :-)
  I think this is related to your Slink death ..

* Hrm. the "client connecting" notification seems to panic if I'm an oper and
  see someone connecting to my local server.

* various strange deaths in the parser.. this one confuses me

* If a client gets killed for flooding, sometimes you'll see one or two
  lines *from* that client appear immediately after the exit. This is most
  probably my problem and its going to be a queue flushing issue ..

Can someone please tidy this up over the next week and commit it? I'd
like to have a hybrid-7 beta out, and i'm now going to be minus some serious
time until Christmas.

Thanks!

committed for now...

- +m moderated channel logic was missing oops.
- removed count of servers in server hide mode in /lusers
- /links will show current server with hop count of 0, everyone else with 1
  in server hide mode to all but opers
- allow half ops to set topic
- removed zlib, better to use system installed lib



*** 20001204_6 by db
- ripped out LIMIT_UH for now. BLOAT BLOAT BLOAT
  in preparation for doing IP throttling ...
- ripped out #ifdef for invisible off or on, that should be in  
  conf anyway. ugh



*** 20001204_5 by db
- redid clear_channel_list code to handle possible buffer overflows
  limiting to 3 mode changes isn't sufficient *sigh*
  I think I got this right, unable to test without another server to link to
  and I'm too tired. ;)
  N.B. this code is very similar to send_mode_list... perhaps can
  combine the two functions. ...



*** 20001204_4 by db
- fixed vchan support, added new back pointer to channel struct
  only set non NULL on sub vchans. This makes it easy ...
- Bugs, what happens when a vchan is peristently kept? There is no longer
  an unique ID to use,since it has no users.



*** 20001204_3 by db
- fixed stupid in channel.c where a non op could generate a mode -o
  message on channel, but it didnt' do anything. Mis-placed if...



*** 20001204_2 by db
- added half ops.. BitchX freaks with it, but epic is fine.
  figures. anyway, we can #ifdef this out in production if we want.



*** 20001204_1 by db
- fixed m_kline.c code
- removed all traces of restricted I line code, thats better handled
  using half ops anyway.
- removed horrible '|' oper only messages in mtrie_conf.c
- fixed /stats K in m_stats.c for opers
- redid send_mode_list in channel.c to account for possible buffer overflow
  even with 3 bans per channel..



*** 20001203_13 by db
- fixed bug in m_names.c removed redundant/duplicate code in m_names.c
  which was already in channel.c



*** 20001203_12 by db
- removed DEBUG code from dlink



*** 20001203_11 by db
- removed REJECT_HOLD that should be replaced with IP throttling
- moved safe_write into fileio.c for now, changed to use fbopen() etc.
  let caller close the FBFILE 
- replaced vchan double link list in channel struct with dlink_list
- Still pending bugs in m_names.c, its displaying channels twice



*** 20001203_10 by db
- modified code to use dlink_node/dlink_list for oper_list serv_list
  and lclient_list (local clients) this gets rid of my evil double link
  list code mess, cleans up the code a lot more still..
  I think we really need to have another global (sigh) for the current
  uplink Client pointer for leafs...

  moved some tests where they make more sense for the new world order



*** 20001203_1 by db
- tidied up m_nick.c more in modules
  removed a nick <-> server test, replaced it with a simpler strchr(nick,'.')
  test. nicks can NEVER have a dot in them, and servers must ALWAYS
  have a dot in their name.
- cleaned up all functions in m_nick.c checking for specific paramater
  counts as the protocol specifies..



*** 20001202_13 by db
- fixed dlinkMoveList, there are three cases to contend with
  1) empty from list 2) empty to list 3) move the spaghetti pointers around



*** 20001202_12 by db
- fixed DEBUG_BLOCK_ALLOCATOR for free_dlink_node case so it will
  no longer core in sprintf.. all the free calls are "wrapped" 
  in ircd_def.h .. to include a file name and line number, without
  free_dlink_node being wrapped, it tried to print a non-existent filename
  oops

- I removed the "wrapped" free_link in ircd_def.h as well no longer used.
  which reminds me...

- LIMIT_UH code in the new world order is currently =broken= until
  it understands how to properly use dlink_node etc. Someone else
  bored and care to fix?

- Added reference counting to dlink_node =for now= *ICK* barf its an
  #ifdef .. I don't want it going out into production like that either adrian.
  I'll remove before the beta cut.

*** 20001202_10 by toot
made vchan_map in to a dlink_list,
not tested loads, but it seems to work


*** 20001202_9 by db
- made list_length a generic function moved into tools.c
  renamed as dlink_list_length()



*** 20001202_8 by db
- add code to move a list from one to the other, this makes
  de-opping an entire channel a simple job of moving lists over from
  the chanop list to the peon list.



*** 20001202_7 by db
- real fix for channel.c change_channel_membrship
- fixed missing prototypes in tools.h that would have found previous bug



*** 20001202_6 by toot
typo in m_admin.. blah :)


*** 20001202_5 by toot
. let unregistered clients use /admin, but non hunting
. non-opers can do /time locally.


*** 20001202_4 by toot
fixed some compile errors/typos


*** 20001202_3 by db
- recoded send_members in channel.c so it actually works
  its still a dogs breakfast... but =better=



*** 20001202_2 by db
- connect bursts are still broken, but it works enough to 
  be usable. More debugging to do.
- cleaned up m_nick.c a tiny bit more. what a steeeninkng mess



*** 20001202_1 by db
- change_channel_membership was screwing up, since dlinkDelete does
  not zero the dlink_list->head pointer in all cases. *sigh* dunno
  what I did wrong. anyway, this hack fixes it for now.



*** 20001201_8 by db
- fixed m_who.c
- optimized m_sjoin.c a bit



*** 20001201_7 by db
- fix to whois... this function needs review... it "feels" wrong... sigh



*** 20001201_6 by db
- fixed m_names.c missing reply_to_send = 1



*** 20001201_5 by db
- tidy up LITTLE_I_LINE code remove #ifdef's



*** 20001201_4 by db
- massive commit, this removes ALL SLink's ick
  NOTE that not everything is working yet, notably server link..
  but this doesn't core right away. ;) and appears to run.



*** 20001201_3 by davidt
fixed gettext support a bit, and added some docs

*** 20001201_2 by adrian


aiee! clear the socket timeout *before* calling the timeout handler.
If we clear it after, we miss any timeouts set by the timeout handler.
(think multiple-ping checks ..)


*** 20001201_1 by adrian


add a flush list, which looks precisely like a socket timeout as it is
right now, but its designed to be used if we want to flush data out
at a certain time rather than immedidately.

Think "flood protection".

Note that this is implemented inside the comm_checktimeouts() loop.
This is done because we want to eventually only have exactly *one*
walk of the entire fd list/clients once a second, rather than multiple.



*** 20001130_22 by db
- majorly reworked m_sjoin.c remove_our_ops and channel.c send_mode_list
  because of the original RFC that started this stupidity off, trying to
  do four modes at a time is risky due to possible buffer overflow ;-(
  Taking the time to strlen() before adding to output buffer seems
  CPU intensive to me. soooo back to 3 mode changes per. This should
  speed up sjoin's a lot now.



*** 20001130_21 by db
- rewrote send_mode_list in channel.c The original was pathetic
  strcat this strcpy that. UGH. This should run much faster.



*** 20001130_20 by db
- fixed broken messages stuff for now I'll double check with David tomorrow
- redid how m_sjoin.c did a remove ops



*** 20001130_19 by davidt
m_error.so wasn't being built.

*** 20001130_18 by db
- removed CUSTOM_ERR define no longer needed
- removed offsetof no longer needed



*** 20001130_17 by davidt
Removed CUSTOM_ERR, and changed it to use gettext(), which allows the
message files to be changed at run time, currently using
/quote set MSGLOCALE ... ('custom' for the custom messages, or anything else
to use the standard ircd messages).
Also, added general_message_locale to the new config file.
If gettext() isn't available, it should just use the standard ircd messages.


*** 20001130_16 by db
- fixed core bug in m_names.c
  


*** 20001130_15 by adrian


move read_packet() and parse_client_queued() into packet.c.
s_bsd.c is meant to be a place where BSD socket type stuff
happens, not parsing client messages.

This is the precursor tidyup which will make implementing the recvq
flooding code talk..



*** 20001130_14 by db
- removed the evil local struct Client hack and added a new LocalUser
  "localClient" part. If non NULL, this client struct is a local client..
  I suppose we can now get rid of local_flag?



*** 20001130_13 by adrian


* kill client[] buffer in the Client struct. We don't need this at all
  with the advent of the linebuf
* Tidy up a couple of assert()s to be more tasteful to me
* note that the count; entry in the Client struct is now only used to
  denote local/remote clients with some evil splitting of the client struct
  and memory allocation. This is evil and should be killed at someone's
  earliest convienence and replaced with a LocalClient struct which attaches
  to the end of a struct Client ..




*** 20001130_12 by adrian


* added an Id tag
* we needed to keep those bzero()'s. Hrm, I wonder why ...
  What happened was that we'd have get a line in, and then immediately flush
  some previously printed garbage. Weird.


*** 20001130_11 by db
- similar bug to parse.c in modules.c when increasing moduletable



*** 20001130_10 by db
- added two new parms to parser hide_server hide_chanops yes or no
- added possible fix (untested by adrian?) to parse.



*** 20001130_9 by adrian


We don't need to bzero, now that the memory routines return the memory
zero'ed for us ..



*** 20001130_8 by db
- removed memset() 0 after MyMalloc its done already 



*** 20001130_7 by db
- no need to memset to zero in channel.c now either



*** 20001130_6 by db
- MessageTree stuff should be in parse.h not msg.h
- Seeing as MyMalloc now zeros memory, no need to do it in blalloc



*** 20001130_5 by adrian


bzero() the memory we get from malloc() before returning. This is a good
thing(tm), and it means we can possibly start removing bzero/memset's
from around the code.



*** 20001130_4 by db
- fixed kick so nonops see user kicking themselves in chanop hide mode
- don't show uplink on links and hopcount if in server hide mode



*** 20001130_3 by db
- committed the chanop hiding code. wheeee
  still needs testing



*** 20001130_2 by db
- server names should not be given in /squit messages if
  server hide is turned on



*** 20001130_1 by db
- squished bug in m_names.c which caused the module to suddenly
  throw up when names without a paramter was given. I forgot
  the case where a client had no channels it was on, trying to 
  indirect through a NULL struct Link is bad for the modules health.



*** 20001129_10 by db
- fixed m_squit.c
- account for LazyLink's in channel.c destroy_channel()
  can be used for both persistent channels and lazy links now
  removing more BLOAT
- -O2 in Makefile.in for modules was doing weirdnesses, hard coded to -g for now



*** 20001129_9 by db
- fixed persistent channels
- fixed IsSetCallerId typo



*** 20001129_8 by db
- pile of cleanups mostly in comments
- added persistent channels tentatively for now, finesse it later
- redid s_user.c code to clean that up



*** 20001129_7 by davidt
Directory /cvsroot/ircd-hybrid-7/messages added to the repository


*** 20001129_6 by db
- renamed misnamed log_user_connect -> log_user_exit
- move X line check into separate function (LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
  ALL ALONG)
 



*** 20001129_5 by db
- reworked register_user
  moved all check for conf/kline notification etc. back into s_conf.c
  where I think maybe it belongs, in any case, this cleans up register_user
  no more **char preason. *ugh*
- removed the kludge '|' handling in reasons. *ugh*

  Who knows what evil lies in ircd code...



*** 20001129_4 by db
- redid luser code, removed cache, if this is still needed after all the
  bug fixes done (!) then add an event to recalculate luser counts.

- added user_welcome() function to s_user.c to start factoring this up
  I hate monolithic functions...

  What evil functions lurks in the heart of ircd?, the shad0w knows.




*** 20001129_3 by db
- cleaned up user and oper file logging. use fbopen etc.
  use eventAdd to close user log for resync



*** 20001129_2 by db
- removed more #define's
- cleaned up client.c/client.h some more



*** 20001129_1 by db
- I removed isbot tests. those are quite obsolete and were BLOAT
- I added skeleton for server side ignore new user mode +u
- This adds a new command module "m_accept"
  This code needs to be finished...
- removed rehash gline rehash tkline BLOAT
- tidied up linebuf.c to use \r and \n like K&R intended



*** 20001128_11 by adrian


Revoke FDLIST_BUSYCLIENT for the time being - we need to sort out
how we place things in the fd lists, and we need to keep the flow
of FD events at a steady rate.

The trouble right now is that if we don't have any idle fd's being
triggered, we end up waiting an entire second for their IO to
complete. This is too long. :-)



*** 20001128_10 by db
- removed unused FLUD code



*** 20001128_9 by db
- ripped out FLUD, right idea, wrong approach.



*** 20001128_8 by db
To quote RFC1459.txt

The NOTICE message is used similarly to PRIVMSG.  The difference
   between NOTICE and PRIVMSG is that automatic replies must never be
   sent in response to a NOTICE message.  This rule applies to servers
   too - they must not send any error reply back to the client on
   receipt of a notice.  The object of this rule is to avoid loops
   between a client automatically sending something in response to
   something it received.  This is typically used by automatons (clients
   with either an AI or other interactive program controlling their
   actions) which are always seen to be replying lest they end up in a
   loop with another automaton.

NOTICE now no longer replies with "NO SUCH NICK" if a nick recipient
does not exist etc.



*** 20001128_7 by db
- fixed m_message to work properly. i.e. oper $# messages work
  NO_SUCH_NICK now work properly



*** 20001128_6 by davidt
Fixed broken build

*** 20001128_5 by db

  gah! I am looking forward to the death of the h6 tree. it sucks.



*** 20001127_11 by db
- fixed reference to version in module, its a **char pointer. 



*** 20001127_10 by db
- fixed a few typos



*** 20001127_9 by bill

 - added _moddeinit()


*** 20001127_8 by db
- fixed modload/modunload yes. they work now



*** 20001127_7 by db
- added deinit



*** 20001127_6 by db
- modunload now works. But all modules need to be updated to add a deinit
  function *sigh* I did m_admin.c, 59 more to go



*** 20001127_5 by db
- fixed parse.c and modules.c



*** 20001127_4 by adrian


We should only allow a buffer to be obtained via linebuf_get() if it
is terminated!



*** 20001127_3 by adrian


Add initial documenation of the new linebuf code
(god I love documenting ..)



*** 20001127_2 by db
- interim check in, I hate checking in partially debugged code
  but I have to do some real work for a bit,
  /modunload cores ..



*** 20001127_1 by db
- fixed modules code to use version string as well
- fixed parse to use prefix tree code
- modload modunload hooks in place, need admin flags 
- fixed m_help to use original msgtab 



*** 20001126_10 by db
- got tired of a compile warning



*** 20001126_9 by db
- re-enabled send_operwall



*** 20001126_8 by db
- .depend included references to in6.h which ltnx didn't have oops.
- committed bysin's whois fix



*** 20001126_7 by db
- Seeing as there is next to nothing left of irc2.8 I'm removing
  it from the patchlevel.



*** 20001126_6 by adrian


Hrm, return the number of lines parsed by linebuf_parse() - this'll be
used later on by some anti-flood code at a later date.



*** 20001126_5 by adrian


We don't need these. YAY.



*** 20001126_4 by adrian


Adrian's totally massive evil dbuf die and linebuf code.

* dbuf.c and dbuf.h have gone. Byebye.
* some of the stuff in s_debug.c which reports dbuf stats has been
  #if 0'ed for the time being
* linebuf flushing (ie write()ing to a socket) is now done through
  linebuf_flush() which does the state keeping, saving a whole lot of
  dbuf map/delete and tracking that existed before
* dopacket() was killed, since we now handle line-by-line parsing of both
  server *and* client recvq buffers. dopacket() did some CRLF-type splitting
  magic because a single buffer when doing ZIPLINKS could possibly be
  more than on ircd line.
* deliver_it() was also killed, since we don't need that extra complexity.
* A lot of linebuf fixes are brought in because well, we needed them!


How the linebuf stuff is used (in a nutshell)

* linebuf_put() is called to put a complete line into a buffer. It has
  to be a line.
* linebuf_parse() is called to put one or more lines into a buffer.
  Incomplete lines and multiple lines are handled.
* When a line is terminated, it is appended with a CR/LF/NUL .

  NOTE that the NUL isn't counted in the length!


Ok - this code is very very alpha. It works, and I can link to another
hybrid server. There are a lot of extras I have to add to this code
before it can be used in a public network, like:

* fixing flood protection to take into account alloclen rather than len.
  This is more relevant to memory usage
* fix the flood protection to only appear in one place (ie after
  linebuf_parse() ) rather than the 10935083405 places it exists now
* I should add multiple-size support in the linebuf code, because we might
  end up wanting to support > 512 line buffers for server connections
* .. and yes, we should really test this to break it, to make sure I haven't
  forgotten anything.

*** 20001125_1 by toot
. moved mo_testline into a module
. added idletime setting for use in ircd.conf


*** 20001124_5 by bill

 - changed DPATH and the like from "/usr/ejb/ircd/" to "/usr/local/ircd/"
   maybe ejb could just ln -sf /usr/ejb /usr/local?

- fixed m_userhost



*** 20001121_3 by adrian


Add in the beginnings of my new and hopefully improved dbuf replacement.

The general idea here is that we *should* be pre-parsing buffers into lines
so we can later throw references around.

src/dbuf.c throws data into the dbuf and parses it when its coming out.
This code parses data into lines when it comes in, so its already
in a per-line format (minus the trailing CRLFs) when we come to parsing
it.

Its building, but I haven't tested it yet. THAT is next.




*** 20001121_2 by adrian

Actually create a tools module with stuff that is abused reguarly,
and rip some of squid's dlink-list management stuff.

I'll commit some code which uses them soon, so people have something
to work with.

This should remove a *lot* of ugliness/duplication in dlink list
management. :)



*** 20001121_1 by db
- general cleanups continue, just a few this time
- ltrace removed for now, it can go back in later



*** 20001119_2 by davidt
modularised m_motd, so /MOTD works once again.
motd.c still contains various file reading/sending commands, which are
used elsewhere, although motd.c probably isn't the best name any more.


*** 20001119_1 by davidt
fixes for poll.  It seems to work, although there's probably a bug lurking
in there somewhere...


*** 20001118_3 by toot
removed all those OLD_* defines in set_mode()


*** 20001118_2 by toot
End of /NAMES list was missing in one place.
fixed compile warning in ltrace

fix for gcc warnings, and do a fd_note on nickchanges.


*** 20001117_2 by davidt
- added missing _modinit function to m_gline.c
- removed #ifdef LTRACE from m_ltrace.c

  OPENSSL


*** 20001117_1 by toot
. made a separate ircd.conf setting to block nickchanges when banned,
  and block them in +m chans too, unless opped
. fixed a typo i made in can_send() :P


*** 20001116_7 by toot
(quiet_on_ban stuff)
  +o/+v should be able to speak even if banned
  only check local connections, to save CPU, and avoid "desync" messages on mixed nets
  take account of +e's

it's safe to send more than 3 +b/e/d/I modes on a netjoin, so use upto MAXMODEPARAMS


*** 20001116_6 by toot

  as invalid, @+ and @+ are treated as +
- Made sendto_channel_type's check for MODE_VOICE before MODE_CHANOP.
- m_notice.c and m_privmsg.c are obsolete (merged into m_message.c),
  and weren't being built anyway.


*** 20001116_3 by davidt
- Figured out how to create a .so without the .tmp file..

this tree seems to compile/run correctly for me on Linux, hopefully
I didn't break anything elsewhere..


*** 20001116_2 by davidt
- modules/Makefile.in modified to work with gmake (like src/Makefile.in)
- src/Makefile.in @DL_OPEN@ removed, since configure doesn't use this

- modules/Makefile in removed, since it should be generated by configure
  like src/Makefile


*** 20001116_1 by davidt
Removed uneeded malloc in modules.c (and the corresponding bogus free,

- src/s_bsd_poll.c added the glibc compatibility fixes



*** 20001114_4 by db
- small change to parse.c, this makes more sense to me

  no worse then m_whois.c on client structs etc. blah. Anyway, move
  stuff from whowas.c into m_whowas.c in modules..

- Added NOTICE fix up mention in TODO list



*** 20001114_1 by db
- A long time ago, in an ircd far far away, there was one a function called

  m_privmsg.c and m_notice.c ... I really don't see the point, they
  share too much functionality, they both do the same thing blah blah blah.
  Its really miserable fixing something in m_privmsg.c only to duplicate
  the work in m_notice.c as well.

*** 20001111_1 by db
- initial rewrite of m_list.c moved some code into channel.c for the moment.
  is- can do a better job on this later (HI!)

- m_admin now only available locally if unregistered (rodder's fix in 6)
  this allows one to figure out just who the loser is thats connecting
  to your server without having to register... yet gets rid of the 
  stupid nick collide "feature"

- modules/Makefile should really be generated from configure no? for now
  I've modified modules/Makefile to generate m_list.so again since I've
  moved some of the depedancies out of m_list.c
  is- can figure out what to do with this later. (HI again!) at least
  the code is sane now. (I've left code #if 0 out in m_list.c so it
  can go back in later)



*** 20001110_3 by db
- added missing m_list.c in Makefile.in



*** 20001110_2 by db
- channel specific stuff should stay in channel.c ya ya ya 
  anyway, m_join.so was having a nit pick fit over names_on_this_channel()
  which of course, was way over in m_names.so.... so I have renamed
  the function to channel_member_names() and placed it into channel.c
  Ignore the mods to src/m_join.c duh. everything m_* in src goes away...

  Eventually in an universe far far away, channel becomes channel.so
  which means, it will have to have a list of dependancies on it to unload
  and reload or something, or maybe just unload all the m_ functions and
  reload autoload? Sometime in an alternate universe...

modules appear to be mostly working now, apart from a small problem with
the mtree that means it won't recognise any commands.
m_error and m_list are now built as part of the core for now..
still no make install for modules/




*** 20001109_4 by db
- only ctcp flud check if local client *oops* This was a side effect
  of combinging ms_privmsg/ms_notice back into one...



*** 20001109_3 by ejb
finished converting modules/*, just some work to do in src/ to make
it compile and stuff now.



*** 20001109_2 by db
- remember, mo_close is only called if an oper, no need to double check



*** 20001109_1 by ejb
convert a few more m_functions, only 8 left to do now.  most of them
will compile, although a couple will not and src/ircd will still not
link.  as i said, will try to fix that tonight.



*** 20001108_8 by ejb
Initial commit of loadable modules support.  right now we can
load modules, but not unload them.  support for adding commands
via modules is there, and about 50% of the m_*.c has been ported.
currently ircd will neither compile nor link properly, but i 
wanted to commit this as soon as possible.. from now on if you
modify m_*.c please edit the version in modules/ rather than
in src/, since src/m_*.c will disappear soon.

i'll try to make another commit tomorrow that fixes compilation,
and allows ircd to be used ..

also we need a modules.txt that explains how to write modules.

so, if you need a working ircd now, sorry, you'll have to wait
until tomorrow :/

(btw if anyone feels like porting the rest of modules/m_*.c (i've done
up to m_operwall.c so far), just look at one of the existing ones
as an example, all you need is the struct Message and _modinit()
function).  as for global symbols defined in modules (this is why
ircd won't link right now), i have a solution to this which i can
hopefully also commit tomorrow.

* Adding socket timeout information
* remove FD list code, since its in a seperate file
* cosmetic changes

filedescriptor management and file management.



*** 20001108_4 by adrian


Enforce FD limits in file_open()



*** 20001108_3 by adrian


Updates on the network code documentation. Add documentation for the FD lists
and FD management code.



*** 20001108_2 by adrian


Initial non-optimised version of my fd list code.

The idea is that for the most part, we can detect busy and idle clients
at IO register time (and, at the outside, we can re-decide when we get
a ping back from a client..)

The FD list is passed through comm_setselect() as its second argument.
There will be some weirdnesses where FDs shift lists frequently, but I
will play with this code soon.

Read include/fdlist.h for the list of FD lists.



*** 20001108_1 by adrian


Added initial documentation for the event code.

right now), but I'll be adding to it real soon.



*** 20001107_6 by ejb
added support for /undline and /ungline (ported from toot's
patch to -6)

*** 20001106_16 by db
- split m_sjoin.c up a bit more, added vchan support for remote clients
  I want to revisit this code. The problem is, remote servers can have
  more allocated channels per user, and we have a fixed sized vchan map ;-(
  So, whats fine locally may be too small for a remote user. Perhaps the
  vchan map should be a link list? or we suffer with scanning all vchans
  for remote clients?

- moved vchan map into all clients even remote, section. blech. read
  comments above.

- cleaned up m_cjoin a bit

I hate doing it, but here it is. One blind commit to rip out ziplinks
from hybrid-7, as they will be re-implemented later on as an external
process rather than be in the code.

the actual zip files haven't been removed, since I'm probably going to
reuse them very soon now.

This hasn't been tested. It compiles. I will do more testing this evening,
and probably do some much needed tidyups to the client/server send and
receive code.



*** 20001106_8 by adrian


fd limit checking is done in comm_open() now, so remove a superflous check.
This has the added advantage of killing an incorrect close() which should
have been an fd_close(), but it doesn't matter much now ..

*** 20001106_5 by adrian


Rearrange the Makefile targets so 'make' in src does the right thing(tm).



*** 20001106_4 by adrian


Finally kill the DNS cache code altogether from the API. gethost_byname()
and gethost_byaddr() now are void functions, rather than struct DNSReply *
functions. If we want to implement a DNS cache, we can do it later with
some callback trickery without having to always check the result and do
trickery in all the client code. (Which makes things hard to follow :-)

The users of gethost_ were converted to assume the callback will be made
at some future time. Note that we can't simply call the callback inside
gethost_ because it'd break things. (What you'd do is have a function
called res_callbackhits() before comm_select() is invoked to do the DNS
callbacks for any cache hits..)



*** 20001106_3 by db
- even more cleanups
  removed a pile of unused #ifdef's lets move these into runtime config
  or EVEN better loadable modules. (hint is- hint hint hint)

  And oh yes, show oper passwords on failure wasn't is-'s fault. happy now?

  Ok, sjoin from remote server for a vchan is going to be interesting.
currently our vchan map is only kept for local clients. duh.
find_vchan() won't work on a remote client. duh. (vhan_map)
The question now is, do we extend vchan_map to remote clients as well
and fill in the map on sjoins? or figure out its a remote client
and walk the vchan link list instead for remote clients?
*sigh* The map is definitely faster for local clients, as it is filled
in in m_join and m_part etc....
Actually, the idea of caching them as found for remote clients 
sounds like the best compromise...

  


*** 20001106_2 by db

* add /stats F / /stats f support from opers to dump the current
  open sockets. This could do with more info being dumped, but its fun
  for debugging right now.
* add Server: and Nick: in front of the server and nick connections
  so /stats F looks useful
* .. and finally, use fd_note() in src/m_nick.c to set the nickname
  description whenever the client sets its nick.

IsLocal() isn't functional. Grr.

with REJECT_HOLD, we read() from the fd to flush the buffer, instead of
ignoring it. This is event-IO friendly, and it will stop triggering unwanted
read IO events.



*** 20001103_7 by adrian


Implementing comm_open(). This is designed to be a socket() and
fd_open() wrapper which limits the number of possible open FDs to
MASTER_MAX (for the time being - better suggestions please :)

So now, you should be either using file_open() / fbopen(), or
comm_open(), and *NOT* any other calls if you can avoid it.
I haven't wrapped dup/dup2/pipe, since the ircd currently does not
use them.



*** 20001103_6 by adrian


* move highest_fd into fdlist.h and out of s_bsd.h for the time

* add a number_fd variable giving us the number of file descriptors

  and so forth when we're trying to avoid over-flowing the number of
  file descriptors open ..



*** 20001103_5 by adrian

*** 20001103_4 by adrian


local[] is already defined in s_bsd.c, so there is no reason to have
it defined in the poll and kqueue modules.


*** 20001103_3 by adrian

Call init_netio() earlier than anything which could
call comm_setselect(). This is why the resolver wasn't
working with kqueue, because we didn't have the kqueue fd open
at the time the resolver fd was comm_setselect()ed .



*** 20001103_2 by adrian


Tidy up the logging during a connection attempt - print a connect message
*before* calling serv_connect(), because it can generate an error itself,

(This is a side-effect of callbacks, btw. We could get around it, but this
just seems clearer to me.)

I'd give you guys something to play with. :)



*** 20001102_11 by adrian

*** 20001102_10 by adrian


when serv_connect_callback() isn't COMM_OK: 

Log to opers the actual error, rather than it going as a wallop or

which IMHO is where it *should* be going.

* .. like close_connection(), to flush data before the socket closes

This now means peopl get their quit messages back before the FD closes! :P



*** 20001102_5 by adrian


fd_close() is meant to close() the fd, rather than squid's which doesn't
(this is because its got more sane file_open/close and comm_open/close
code ..)

This fixes the fd leak and non-closing fd problems.



*** 20001102_4 by adrian


Initial change over of the server connect() code to use the new world
order(tm).

* Fix a couple of stupidities in my last commit of comm_strerror
* Strip the server connection stuff out of s_bsd.c and move it into
  two functions in s_serv.c - 
  + serv_connect() - initiate a connection to a server (replacing
    connect_server()
  + serv_connect_callback() - completion from comm_connect_tcp() 

Note that there doesn't seem to be checking to see if a /connect server
is actually in the process of being connect'ed. This should happen!

The code works and connects to the server(s) on startup, but /squit and
/connect's fail. I've found that clients that /quit dont have their
sockets closed .. I have to figure that out, which might solve this.

*** 20001102_1 by adrian


oops, forgot to return; after the COMM_ERR_BIND, which meant it still
tried to connect..



*** 20001101_6 by adrian


.. and remember that a retried connect() can return EISCONN which
means the socket is already connect()ed, and its not actually an

This makes the auth code work again. Yay. :)




*** 20001101_5 by adrian


Converting the ident auth code over to use comm_connect_tcp().
Note that this code doesn't entirely work yet, but it doesn't NOT work
(go on, parse that)

* rip the bind() / connect() code out of s_auth.c and use
  comm_connect_tcp() instead

* change send_auth_query() into a CNCB - it is called once 
  comm_connect_tcp() completes in order, and handles errors from
  it before attempting to write to the socket.

* fix comm_connect_tcp() to actually work ! :
  + actually *remember* to record the port
  + don't do DNS lookups on IPs when you want an IP, instead attempt to
    convert it to a in_addr, and if it fails try to look it up with
    gethost_byname()

* Remove all the auth descriptor stuff from send_message(), leaving only
  server connect()s



*** 20001101_4 by adrian


Add a 'local' parameter to comm_connect_tcp() to specify what to bind()
to locally. Currently if NULL is passed no bind() is performed, but later
on this will change to bind() to the virtual server IP if one is
configured.



*** 20001101_3 by adrian


Make the auth read is now done through comm_setselect(), rather than
through read_message(). This means that all read_message() does now
is handle completion of auth and server connect()s, which is next to go.

*** 20001031_2 by adrian


Initial timeout fd stuff. There is no code that uses it yet, but its there
and running for when I (am about to) do.

The idea is that you register a callback to be called after a given time
period has elapsed. This is good for things like checking ping returns,
where you set the timeout period on the fd to be 2*ping, and when you get
a PONG you reset the timeout period. If the socket ever times out, you
get a ping timeout.

Its also going to be used for the up-coming non-blocking connect() code,
where a socket timeout kicks in to prevent a connect() taking too long
to run.

Once check_pings() has been split up, this and the poll/select/etc loop should
be the only two places that walking the entire fd_table[] array is allowed.



*** 20001031_1 by adrian


We should be registering a COMM_SELECT_READ, not WRITE.
The only reason this was working was because the socket was ready
for writing also at the correct time it was ready for reading ..
uhm, sad. :-)

* kill the priority code
* kill the burst mode code (there are still bits and pieces of the variables
  somewhere still.. :)
* call read_message() with a delay of 0, and call comm_select() with delay
  rather than 1. This makes the ircd snappier again ..



*** 20001030_8 by adrian


kill npollfds and use highest_fd in its place, which is just as good.



*** 20001030_7 by adrian


Optimise the read code. When a connection graduates from the auth state
and is upgraded to a client, its added via comm_setselect() to start
reading data.

* read_packet() has been turned into a PF, so it can be called when a
  FD is ready for reading.

* read_packet() has been stripped quite a bit - we *assume* that there
  will be data returned from the read. If not, thats a socket error

* error handling has been moved into read_packet() instead of its return
  value

* note that the data is put into the dbuf as fast as possible, rather than
  being evil and waiting. I'll fix the DoSability of this code at a later
  date, and without ignoring reads. :-P



*** 20001030_6 by adrian


Big big write optimisation, taking client and server writes into the
new network loop:

* flush_sendq_except() is gone. This was called when data was
  added to a dbuf and a new one needed allocating, probably to
  increase network throughput and decrease dbuf usage. It should
  not be needed now.

* send_queued() has been turned into send_queued_write() which is
  an IO callback now.

* send_message() will now *always* schedule a COMM_SELECT_WRITE
  regardless of how small the sendq is. This should up the
  network throughput and reduce the CPU a little.

* send_queued_write() should be rescheduling a COMM_SELECT_WRITE 
  if the dbuf chain hasn't been drained fully. I'm still 
  researching this to make sure the variable 'more' is set in
  the right places.

* fd shutdown code in s_bsd.c called send_queued() to flush dbufs
  before killing the FD. This obviously can't be done now.
  As noted in a comment, when close handlers are implemented
  correctly, the dbuf will be flushed (or attempted to) before
  the FD closes totally, so we just ignore it here for now.

* Make the old-style poll code not register and check write
  events for FDs that need data written. So now, the only
  thing that can trigger a client/server FD write in the old-style
  poll code is the completion of a connect(). All server/client
  FD writes are done through comm_select() in the new world order.

send_message() could probably attempt to call send_queued_write()
rather than waiting for the fd to be ready for writing, but this
is an optimisation for another time. (And easy too, since the
original code for send_message() called send_queued() anyway,
so there shouldn't be any problems there .. :)

fix for mIRC NAT+spoofedI DCC send problem (userhost now returns sockhost
for acptr==sptr).


*** 20001029_2 by db
- m_sjoin.c is still a mess, but starting to split it up into
  manageable pieces. 



*** 20001029_1 by adrian


Kill the flush_*() routines in send.c, since they add an extra level
of complexity and hackiness to where the code *should* be tidy (and
well, I'm going to tidy).

The closing-ircd-flush will be fixed once close handlers are implemented.
They will be soon.



*** 20001028_8 by adrian


Attempt to indent send_message() because I am about to start hacking
on this code, and this indenting wasn't helping..



*** 20001028_7 by adrian


Neatening up the formatting a little bit. There's no concept of 'valid
callback' here in this codebase.



*** 20001028_6 by db
- typo in s_serv.c in vchan handling
  oopsies



*** 20001028_5 by db
- most of the work is done in m_sjoin, it =should= send the mode
  join messages etc. to the right vchan names now.



*** 20001028_4 by db
- ok, did preliminary mods on sjoin to support vchans.
  This function is a pile of festering pus..
  Anyway, it should more or less work but its untested. Still to be
  done is the mods to the sendto_channel etc. so they all send the right
  join messages to the vchans as appropriate.



*** 20001028_3 by db
- rewrote burst code, added new function to do the actual burst. 'bout time.
  rewrote the burst code to send vchans as sub chans of top level channels.
  Next need to redo SJOIN to paste 'em back into sub vchans from burst



*** 20001028_2 by db
- adds /quote events which will list the event queue
  I'd rather add a generic "debug" function later on i.e. something like
  "/quote debug events" "/quote debug memory" etc. etc. but this will
  do for now...



*** 20001028_1 by adrian


move check_pings() into an event, and tidy up a random comment.
check_pings() is now called once a second to make sure we catch all
pings that should be pong'ed, since nextping isn't reset anywhere
in the code anymore. This isn't entirely optimal, but it will do
until I've tidied up the rest of the network code. When this is
done, I'll optimise check_pings() so it doesn't have to do so much
work to decide whether a client/server should have responded.



*** 20001027_1 by toot
made vchan notices into numeric replies.  276-278 don't seem to be used for anything in
any ircd i checked, so went for them


*** 20001026_6 by adrian


Add an explanation to errno ..



*** 20001026_5 by db
- check_klines() has to be called after placing tklines as well



*** 20001026_4 by adrian


Tidy up Dianora's event-ing of the channel_cleanup() code:

* change the declaration of channel_cleanup() so it matches the EVH
  function prototype

* Change the call to eventAdd() to not need the typecast to EVH ..
* .. to pass NULL instead of 0 ..
* .. and split across two lines so the line isn't > 80 characters




*** 20001026_3 by db
- removed checkpings to localize it in ircd.c only



*** 20001026_2 by db
- messed up 4am commit. Here is the changes to config.h



*** 20001026_1 by db
- cleaned up kline code in client.c
- missing check_klines in m_kline.c



*** 20001025_10 by db
- split check_pings into two (like it should have been all along)
  check_pings checks for ping timeouts
  check_kline checks for klines
  both call common exit routine
  m_kline has to call check_kline after placing a kline. It would be
  better if it was put on the nice event queue incase a tcm or oper
  places several klines in a row. But then, opers freak when a kline
  doesn't happen instantly.



*** 20001025_9 by adrian


ResolverFileDescriptor isn't a global FD anymore, so don't declare it
as one.



*** 20001025_8 by adrian


Convert the auth timeout checking to be once a second. I can't see this
sucking too badly because timeout_auth_queries_event() doesn't walk
the entire fd array - instead it walks AuthPollList.



*** 20001025_7 by db
- added evenAdd for cleanup_channels



*** 20001025_6 by adrian


tidy up the highest_fd handling. Now, the handling is done through
fd_open() / fd_close(), reducing the number of places tracking is
done.



*** 20001025_5 by db
- why I deleted that crucial code I don't know
  anyway, privmsgs to channels now works again.



*** 20001025_4 by adrian


Move the listener code to use comm_setselect(). 

* accept_connection() has changed to become a PF function for use
  with comm_setselect()
* When a listener is created, comm_setselect() is called to make
  the initial IO on the FD work
* reworked read_message() in s_bsd_poll.c to deal with no listen sockets

All read_message() does now (!) is handle auth and client/server sockets.
Here's an excerpt from the code explaining the major real change
that happened:

   * Since we're going to rip this code out anyway, the current "hack"
   * will suffice to keep things going. The only two things this loop
   * services now is the auth and client/server fds (resolver and
   * listener FDs are done through the new-style interface) . So,
   * we loop again through the poll_fdarray[] array from scratch again
   * and fd's that are not -1 are ready for us to do read-type events
   * with. The pollfd_array[i].fd = -1; in the auth fd loop stops us
   * from looking at the auth fds as client/server fds which would be
   * a Bad Thing(tm) right now. :-)    -- adrian

* We have to recheck the incoming connection code to ratelimit the number
  of incoming connections/sec to stop connection flooders. Uhm, there was
  some code in read_message() from comstud to do this, I'll move it out
  into accept_connection() once read_message() has gone away.



*** 20001025_3 by adrian


Just set the nonblocking flag when we set a socket non-blocking ..



*** 20001025_2 by adrian


Use the pre-munged poll flags for network IO, rather than creating
our own set of POLL* flags.



*** 20001025_1 by db
- removed NO_JOIN_ON_SPLIT
- cleaned up m_join.c a bit
- removed a pile of uneeded #ifdef's



*** 20001024_4 by adrian


Commit the tidyup of the resolver network code (notice I said *network* :) 
-->

* move init_resolver() to a more useful init place and out of init_netio()
* make the DNS timeout checking an event which is triggered once a second.
  I figure that when I rewrite the event system soon to work on milliseconds
  rather than seconds we might revisit this, but doing it once a second
  actually might be better. Dunno yet..
* add comm_setselect() calls in the resolver init and just after the
  recvfrom() to re-register interest in IO.
* remove the evilness in read_message() which does the IO on
  ResolverFileDescriptor, making resolver IO happen through the new network
  IO system

Notes:

* I have *NO* idea how the DNS write flushing works just yet, I guess I'm
  about to find out.

* The resolver might take a little longer - this is simply the by-product
  of shoehorning in the comm_select() call (if there is no other pending
  IO, read_message() can delay for a bit, since the resolver fd isn't
  covered there.) Once read_message() disappears, so will the delays.
  (or I might just fix it somehow..)



*** 20001024_3 by adrian


Remember to initialise the event subsystem early so we can use it.



*** 20001024_2 by adrian


Arrays start at 0, not 1 in C. When we find out the lowest numbered fd,
we need to make sure npollfds is one more than that value, otherwise the
last filedescriptor won't get polled.



*** 20001024_1 by adrian


Commit the fd state tidyup and new IO loop code.

* I've killed GlobalFDList and replaced it with an array of fd structs.         
  (fde_t). This has the fd state (opened, closed, pending io requests,          
  type, description, etc).                                                      
* I've added fd state tracking stuff (fd_open / fd_close).                      
* I've added file fd state tracking stuff (file_open / file_close)              
* I've tidied up logfile permissions in a place or two                          

There's a little weirdness - if you want to include s_bsd.h, you need
to include fdlist.h as well. This will go away eventually ..



*** 20001023_7 by ryan

changed around order things are done to prevent non-base channel pointer
from being used where base channel pointer should be


*** 20001023_6 by db
- modified cjoin to use the ##channel_name as given in original spec
  this should help us slightly in m_sjoin.c
- started cleaning up m_sjoin.c
- duplicated voodoo code into mo_join.. in m_join.c
  handlers still need a lot of cleanup due to the duplicated code...



*** 20001023_5 by toot
fixed channel.c/remove_empty_channels() so it compiled with 
PRESERVE_CHANNELS #defined


*** 20001023_4 by adrian


Added a port of squid's event system. This is a very simple mechanism
to schedule events to happen in some given time period. The main
function you'll be using is:

eventAdd(const char *text, EVH *func, void *data, time_t when, int weight)

where when is the number of seconds you want to have the event run (so
if you want it running a second from now, you'd set when to be 1.)

Read event.c for a more precise description.

What has changed:

* changed this over to use the Block allocator rather than squid's mempools
* disabled debug reporting until I figure out a nice way (ie how the rest
  of the ircd does it) of doing this
* made the time offsets integer, rather than double like they are in squid
* the logic in io_loop() has been changed to allow this to slide in.

Note that eventAddIsh()'s logic on random offsets might be a bit .. off.
I'll come back to this once I've tidied up bits of the code.

I will also be tidying up io_loop() now an event scheduling mechanism
exists, making it much, much less twisted. So any breaks there will
(hopefully) be temporary.



*** 20001023_3 by adrian





first split of the network code into per-commloop modules. The autoconf
magic came from the squid commloops work by Adrian Chadd (me) and
Benno Rice (benno@holocaine.net).

the poll and select specific stuff was moved into s_bsd_poll.c and
s_bsd_select.c . The chosen file is done through some autoconf magic
and variable substitution in src/Makefile.in. I haven't changed any
code itself, simply un-staticized things and shifted things into
seperate files. This is done to preserve some form of CVS sanity.

A noteable here is that I"ve moved the FD_SETSIZE detection for
select() into s_bsd_select.c rather than ircd.c, since this is a more
logical place to check (and die) if FD_SETSIZE < MAXCONNECTIONS.

The autoconf configuration is done using the following options to
configure:

--enable-poll / --disable-poll : Enable or disable the use of poll()
--enable-select / --disable-select : ENable or disable the use of select()

Note that the current autoconf magic checks if poll() exists - since
we aren't using USE_POLL now, we define ac_cv_func_poll/select/whatever
and this is used further into the autoconf magic to decide the
substitutions to do.

- unreg users can't send version.
- added +a umode, shows oper is admin in whois

- users can see the topic of a -s channel they aren't
  on (but can't set it even if it is -t, to prevent
  topic floods *sigh*)
- many changes in parse.c .. fixed a few bugs, rewrote
  the argument parser code, added support for catching
  users passing not enough parms before the m_ function
  is even called.
- you can now set in ircd.conf whether channels have to
  be +i for an invite to work.
- added a numeric (504) for sending to users trying to
  invite remote users to +i channels.
- started changing m_* functions to not check parc anymore,
  in most cases parse() has already handled this.
- move glines from config.h to ircd.conf

*** 20000330_1 by db
- large resync , folding in a number of changes contributed by is
  This moves some config.h items into the conf file



*** 20000319_1 by lusky
Changed my email address, this is a test commit (jrl)


*** 20000209_1 by db
- fixed goof with removing of an #ifdef for TOPIC_INFO 
  patch done by is- 



*** 20000201_3 by db
- synced up convertconf to current parser format



*** 20000201_2 by tomh

Fix UMR picked up by purify:

*** 20000201_1 by db
- converted separate user/host forms to user="user@host.part"; forms
  it looks nicer, and easier for admins to work with I think. Plus recommended
  by the #coder-com crew. ok.
- fixed stupid in initconf where it missed # commented out lines and
  tried to parse old format as new...
- folded in the old -5 nick collide code already folded into the -6 tree.
  its #ifdef'ed for future fixes...



*** 20000131_1 by db
- improvements to connect section. allow multiple hub_masks etc.



*** 20000124_3 by db
- first work on logging section, 
  logging level can be set from new conf file format now.



*** 20000124_2 by db
- updated convertconf



*** 20000124_1 by db
- removed #ifdef for ZIP_LINKS
  I hate #ifdef's



*** 20000123_2 by db
- added fbunputc mimics unputc (Sorry Tom)
- single conf file, is either old style or new style determined
  at initconf time (Again, sorry Tom)
  Could have done it simpler, but this is safer for now...



*** 20000123_1 by db
- cleaned up some "bare" 512 defines. added new IRCD_BUFSIZE define
- added better error recovery to parser, 
- added better error reporting.
- tentative new conf format mostly finished, will "warp" it a bit
  more to match Kev's proposed format as possible, given undernet vs.
  efnet differences..
- need to handle ircd.conf form as the new format as default,
  and fall back to old format as needed. i.e. kludge code still to 
  be removed in source...



*** 20000122_1 by db
- more cleanup on new conf file parser..
  using "auth" instead of "client" as per Kev's document..



*** 20000121_1 by db
- preliminary serverinfo section done



*** 20000120_1 by db
- CONNECT in new parser works, needs full testing



*** 20000117_3 by db
- added a few more sections



*** 20000117_2 by db
- Added quarantine



*** 20000117_1 by db
- continuing with new parser code... listen/operator tested



*** 20000116_7 by db
- bunch of changes in order to have class names not numbers. *sigh*
  I toyed with the idea of keeping class #'s and having class_names
  to class #' mapping somewhere, but thats just getting silly.. sooo....
  Here we are...



*** 20000116_6 by db
- make_class should return a 0'ed class to be safe



*** 20000116_5 by db
- prelim. change before I start on class names



*** 20000116_4 by db
- oper section complete except for class operations..



*** 20000116_3 by db
- checkpoint with operator section mostly working...
  class code has to be rewritten still



*** 20000116_2 by db
- oops. I changed Makefile rather than Makefile.in



*** 20000116_1 by db
- copyright touch ups
- missing -ll in Makefile



*** 20000115_3 by db
- The lex/yacc files...



*** 20000115_2 by db
- first very rough working lex/yacc under ircd-hybrid..
  parser doesn't actually do anything.... yet...
  Tom, we could use a fileio pushback, to push back a line thats
  "not for us"



*** 20000115_1 by db
- more cleanups to parse code



*** 20000113_3 by db
- someone forgot to add a file. wonder who



*** 20000113_2 by db
- externalized the old parser, unfortunately, this means a lot
  more of the s_conf interface is visible ;-(, can do better in the future...
  This is in preparation for new parser inclusion.
  This will (ick) allow us to use both old conf files and new format conf files
  for backwards compatibility. (I'm not terribly happy about this, but...
  Hi Tom!)



*** 20000113_1 by db
- updated client/deny sections to use new IP_TYPE
- fixed union to use struct ip_value



*** 20000112_1 by db
- returned to ';' at end of each section, this is actually easier to
  recover from errors; just scan for ';'
- updated convertconf to produce test file
- added IP token to lexer and to client section



*** 20000111_11 by db
- added DENY 



*** 20000111_10 by db
- more work on yacc/lex parser
  added "kill" open to discussion, but efnet has "K" and "D" lines
  


*** 20000111_9 by db
- changes to bring it into line with Kev's sample conf just a tiny bit
- removed that dumb ';' at end of sections



*** 20000111_8 by db
- tiny cleanup to Makefile
  Copyright notice fixed 



*** 20000111_7 by db
- added preliminary yacc/lex test parser code



*** 20000111_6 by db
Directory /usr/hybrid/ircd-hybrid-7/src/test/newconf added to the repository


*** 20000111_5 by db
- oops port in connect was quoted



*** 20000111_4 by db
- more tiny tweaks



*** 20000111_3 by db
- tweaks to new conf format



*** 20000111_2 by db
- sample ircd.conf and its converted ircd.conf.new 



*** 20000111_1 by db
- Now pretty much handles a "normal" conf file.. output is
  a "new" style conf format file, with details still to be hashed out.
  Do we want to handle multiple C/N's ? multiple H lines? *sigh* yes
  Thats next, but not yet.
 


*** 20000110_4 by db
- tiny tweak much more to do



*** 20000110_3 by db
- Nearly done. TODO Finish off I lines (I line prefixes)
  HUB or LEAF control set in old M line



*** 20000110_2 by db
- updated Makefile, fleshed out convertconf more



*** 20000110_1 by db
- small cleanup to s_conf.c before the bigger one



*** 20000109_12 by wnder
woopsies


*** 20000109_11 by wnder
Added documentation of the iauth protocol


*** 20000109_10 by db
- bit more fleshing out of convertconf.c



*** 20000109_9 by db
- first rough outline of conversion program to convert old style
  to new style conf file format. No Makefile, incomplete still.



*** 20000109_8 by db
- more cleanups, made consistent... no need for MSG_PRIVMSG/MSG_NOTICE
  other m_ files don't do that



*** 20000109_7 by db
- cleanups



*** 20000109_6 by db
- m_mode bursts/looks for channel mode on uplink in LazyLinks code



*** 20000109_5 by db
- removed uneeded #include



*** 20000109_4 by db
- forgot to remove now unused m_message.c



*** 20000109_3 by db
- split m_privmsg and m_notice into two files. My rationale for doing this
  is: slightly faster, no more if(notice) in code, m_privmsg/m_notice
  rarely change anyway.



*** 20000109_2 by wnder
Added support for when SerialNumber rolls over to 0


*** 20000109_1 by db
- as fbgets is re-entrant, redid .include code. Much nicer



*** 20000108_5 by wnder
Implemented serial number method to keep track of searched nodes.
(hi diane!!)


*** 20000108_4 by db
- LazyLinks /list on leaf is sent to its uplink now
- still bug to track down with leaf connected to hub, hub joins net
  leaf does not see channel bursts properly



*** 20000108_3 by wnder
Implemented unsortable I/K lines


*** 20000108_2 by db
- still slowly working in LazyLinks version 2 code. nick collides
  have to be handled by the LazyLinks uplink, for now sending back
  KILL's (which were removed!) as needed...



*** 20000108_1 by wnder
fixed missing #include "s_conf.h"


*** 20000107_4 by db
- sticky / key



*** 20000107_3 by db
- don't core if chptr == NULL in sendto_match_servs()
  shouldn't normally ever happen, but does in LL 



*** 20000107_2 by db
- closer version of LazyLinks version 2



*** 20000107_1 by db
- split out m_user.c m_nick.c, modified s_user.c s_user.h Makefile.in
  LazyLinks is in unworkable state in this version.



*** 20000106_1 by db
- fixed bug introduced in ReplaceQuotes, '\#' was not handled correctly.



*** 20000105_16 by db
- all over the place



*** 20000105_15 by db
- yet another hidden HUB in .h



*** 20000105_14 by db
- removed more pesky #ifdef HUB hidden in .h files



*** 20000105_13 by db
- always initialize serverMask



*** 20000105_12 by db
- HUB removed, server determines if its HUB or LEAF by looking
  at (Now unused) port line in M line. If its a 1, its a HUB, if
  its missing or anything else, its a LEAF.
  Can be queried from /admin
  Yes, its a hack for now.



*** 20000105_11 by db
- removed HUB from config.h etc. now in a config entry



*** 20000105_10 by db
- allow single dot in user names to allow for "first.last" user name style



*** 20000105_9 by db
- removed unneeded include



*** 20000105_8 by db
- oops. missed comment in m_lljoin.c



*** 20000105_7 by db
- oops. removed comments belonging to channel.c only



*** 20000105_6 by db
- committing the split out m_cburst.c m_drop.c m_lljoin.c



*** 20000105_5 by db
- split out m_drop.c m_cburst.c m_lljoin.c



*** 20000105_4 by db
- further cleanups to s_conf.c



*** 20000105_3 by db
- Further cleanups to s_conf.c



*** 20000105_2 by db
- fixed missing Y line detection code which got broken in clean up



*** 20000105_1 by db
- cleanups to dbuf code. Try to flush connections if dbuf list is
  empty then try to allocate.
- tiny start on new channel hierarchy scheme.



*** 20000104_6 by wnder
Prettied up source files by converting tabs to spaces


*** 20000104_5 by db
- fixed DEBUG error in s_conf.c



*** 20000104_4 by db
- also report how many malloc()'ed dbufs there were max



*** 20000104_3 by db
- changed slightly wording in LazyLinks As Implemented doc
- removed more DEBUGLL debug cruft
- simplified m_join CBURST call



*** 20000104_2 by db
- added "Lazy Links As Implemented in Hybrid" doc



*** 20000104_1 by db
- removed more #ifdef's removed BAN_INFO BAN_UH



*** 20000103_7 by db
- mods to try to flush connections if dbufs are used up



*** 20000103_6 by db
- it all works now (LL). channel cleanup etc. 



*** 20000103_5 by db
- this version doesn't core as often. *sigh*
  cleanup channels code needs to be gone over again, its stable
  without.
- removed some cruft and useless comments from client.c



*** 20000103_4 by db
- *sigh* code got lost in the shuffle
  fix stats c so n lines show as n not N
  fix spacing on 333 numeric to match others




*** 20000103_3 by db
- removed last vestige of TOPIC_WHO define



*** 20000103_2 by db
- fixed a typo in ircd.c



*** 20000103_1 by db
- Folded in Perly's cleanup channel code. The idea is to remove
  channels from the lazylinks leaf server if no local members are on them
  and they haven't been used by anyone locally in a "while" where
  "while" is set in s_serv.h CLEANUP_CHANNELS_TIME seconds.
  I've redone the destroy channel code. It should work, but its untested.
  CLEANUP_CHANNELS_TIME is set way low still for debugging,
  its currently 30 seconds. In production it could range from 15 to 60 minutes
  I'd guess.



*** 20000102_9 by db
- key handling was broken in m_cburst



*** 20000102_8 by db
- oops got an if backwards key when NULL cores it



*** 20000102_7 by db
- try to negotiate a non LL connect if serverMask's get all used up
- report all serverMask's used up. That will mean a recode ;-)



*** 20000102_6 by db
- fixed a bug in m_join.c
- cleaned up LL channel key handling
- don't assign serverMask's to non LL servers



*** 20000102_5 by db
- added LazyLinks.txt document outlining original Lazy Links protocol
  its been modified for -7
- ensure serverMask of 0 just causes restoreUnusedServerMask to return



*** 20000102_4 by db
- First working Lazy Links implementation
  still needs debugging/testing etc.



*** 20000102_3 by db
- bug reported by Colten Edwards in m_userhost.c



*** 20000102_2 by db
- oops bogus code in m_sjoin.c



*** 20000102_1 by db
- few tidy ups in prelim LL code



*** 20000101_4 by db
- implemented DROP, not tested, not used yet.



*** 20000101_3 by db
- Preliminary rough cut at Lazy Links, still a lot of mopping up to do
  'n' in c/n's means try lazy link, 'N' means do normal.



*** 20000101_2 by db
- Cleanups to allow DEBUGMODE to compile



*** 20000101_1 by db
- cleanup of LITTLE_I_LINES #ifdef



*** 19991231_4 by db
- renamed channel to GLobalChannelList in jupe channel code



*** 19991231_3 by db
- more cleanup of s_conf.c



*** 19991231_2 by db
- Preliminary cleanups on s_conf.c



*** 19991231_1 by db
- missing NULL assignment would cause double free's and eventual
  core on malformed U: lines.



*** 19991230_11 by wnder
more iauth fixups - this should finish it!


*** 19991230_10 by wnder
IAuth fixups


*** 19991230_9 by db
- oopsies in opcount code spotted by Perly.. flag has to be used
  before set...



*** 19991230_8 by db
- more missed updates local_cptr_list -> LocalClientList



*** 19991230_7 by db
- missed a opcount-- in m_sjoin.c
- missed an #endif for IAUTH



*** 19991230_6 by db
- Added chanop counter to Channel struct, keep track of current op count
  use instead of that nasty loop in SJOIN code



*** 19991230_5 by db
- folding back in USE_IAUTH code



*** 19991230_4 by db
- completion of mop up of resync with -6 tree. Compiles again



*** 19991230_3 by db
- mop up of resync of -7 with -6



*** 19991230_2 by db
- mop up -7 tree resync with -6



*** 19991230_1 by db
resync with current ircd-hybrid-6 tree



*** 19991217_1 by db
1) folded in d line fix from -6
2) folded in res.c core bug fix from -6



*** 19991109_1 by db
- changes to sendto_one_type to not send @# style of message to non
  CHW servers
- m_userhost old behaviour restored, but rewritten. Need to support
  up to 5 userhost requests, this fixes ircle clients which depend on
  this behaviour.



*** 19991022_1 by db
- disallow -ve limit on mode #channel +l 



*** 19991017_2 by db
- missing mask check in IP kline code. no idea why.



*** 19991017_1 by db
- removed (+) cruft as this was a Tanerism



*** 19991013_10 by tomh
Removed CONNECTFAST garbage, it was causing production boxes to load up on
SYNs on the primary port and killing poll performance.


*** 19991013_9 by lusky
fixed m_ison to put trailing space on 303 responses
CONNECTFAST is always defined for USE_POLL now, was causing very poor
  accept performance on heavily loaded non-Solaris machines using poll()


*** 19991013_8 by tomh
put USE_POLL back in setup.h.in, removed stuff that wasn't needed


*** 19991013_7 by lusky
syncd config.h.dist to config.h


*** 19991013_6 by wnder
missing macros


*** 19991013_5 by lusky
updated opers.txt to include set log


*** 19991013_4 by db
- fixed misnomer



*** 19991013_3 by db
- corrected table in s_log.c for log level to string



*** 19991013_2 by db
- added strings to m_set LOG



*** 19991013_1 by db
- botched wild card matching fixed



*** 19991011_1 by db
  It turns out, that cptr->fd is <0 in some cases when its being used, just
as Q described. I was confused at first, because it sounded like he
was saying cptr was =freed= then being used. It appears its still a valid
pointer, but its fd has been closed...

  The ideal solution would be to make sure the cptr is removed from the 
channel link list before the code even gets to sendto_common_channels()

  In any case, using an fd < 0 in this section is a BAD THING 



*** 19991009_1 by db
- better fix for umode code



*** 19990925_1 by db
- simpler mode letter to bit mask table lookup, safer



*** 19990924_2 by db
- yet another ->name instead of ->user this one in report_tklines



*** 19990924_1 by db
- This patch corrects a case where a normal user can oper themselves. oops.
- It also corrects a possible core due to a bogus H or L line. (neph)



*** 19990914_1 by wnder
IAuth updates:
 * mtree.c is (hopefully) approaching it's final stages - much
   more bulletproof now.


*** 19990913_1 by wnder
IAuth updates:
 * added a new mtree module - handles I: and K: lines. Please
   throw all sorts of odd combinations at it to give it a good
   run - highly experimental :-)

*** 19990909_2 by wnder
more #ifdef USE_IAUTH stuff


*** 19990909_1 by wnder
Ok, sorry for the broken compile - I put all the iauth code
in the ircd tree under #ifdef USE_IAUTH so hopefully nothing
else will be affected until it's good and ready - i'll do a
checkout after this to make sure everything's fine.

ircd needs these changes to work with iauth - as of right now,
ircd attempts a connection to 127.0.0.1 port 4444 where it
expects the IAuth server to be - you just need to run
-7/iauth/source/iauth first so it listens on 4444. In the future,
the iauth host/port will be dynamically configurable.


*** 19990902_4 by wnder
ident support
