fix for duplicate 401's for kick #validchan invalnick
ServerStats->is_ref is incremented twice on an X-line
  which is set to 1 (jdc)
STATS P notifications were not sent to opers (jdc)
stats l/L target to FLAGS_SPY (if STATS_NOTICE) (jdc)
uname info only displayed to opers
If X-line port field is 2, reject client but do not send
  a notification to opers
STATS y/Y now oper-only
did NOT add any of the other conf line display restrictions, I think
  we should integrate control of those on a per-line basis in the new
  conf format.


*** 20001020_1 by toot
msg nick with no text made it core..
privmsg/notice give different errors depending what args are missing, so
they check it instead of parse()


*** 20001019_5 by toot
/list #channel was showing the wrong key :P


*** 20001019_4 by toot
cleaned m_list slightly..


*** 20001019_3 by toot
. /join just skips over a subchan you're already in, instead of giving an error.
. /list shows vchans as #chan<!key> if there's subchans for it..


*** 20001019_2 by db
- removed the dns cache built into res.c
- will have to fill out cres_mem with something more appropriate



*** 20001019_1 by lusky
dns cache entries were never fully expiring, stayed in the hashtable forever


*** 20001018_1 by db
- fixed core with who of client not on a channel. ooops
- fixed mo_privmsg
- fixed @# style channel messages 



*** 20001017_1 by lusky
fixed a bug tickled by sending a bogus SERVER command from hacked server
auditted leakage of IP address from get_client_name calls


*** 20001016_10 by db
- prelim changes for m_topic



*** 20001016_9 by toot
now it will remove the basechan when there's no vchans left under it


*** 20001016_8 by toot
. this should remove the basechan after deleting its last vchan, but didn't
. don't bother to show possible vchans if they're already
  in one of them.
. there's one case where the root is empty, and there's only one
  vchan.. just have them join that vchan.
. displays the last nick to join each vchannel for now, and won't show empty vchans


*** 20001016_7 by toot
map_vchan checks root channel too


*** 20001016_6 by db
- semi fixed whois



*** 20001016_5 by toot
. don't allow JOIN to a 'real' subchan name
. some extra brackets in privmsg/notice to kill a compile warning
. mpw JOIN #chan !nick will work on any nick in the channel, just need to
  update show_vchans


*** 20001016_4 by db
- global who should work when its a wild card mask



*** 20001016_3 by db
- fixed bug in m_who



*** 20001016_2 by db
- added prelim vchan support to notice as well
- still have to do @# type of vchan 



*** 20001016_1 by db
- fixed stupid bug with vchan == chptr i.e. top level chptr == vchan
  that would result in it never being removed, since vchan == chptr (top chan)
  would never result in a match ... this led to rework of privmsg to channel

- kick appears to work now on vchan



*** 20001015_5 by db
- m_who.c what a MESS



*** 20001015_4 by db
- the m_mode changes needed
  this allows you to mode +o etc. on sub chans. wheeeeeee



*** 20001015_3 by db
- m_names now recognizes vchan names



*** 20001015_2 by db
- slightly rewrote m_names. its still a stinking mess but getting there
- added function call to make vchan names listing easier



*** 20001015_1 by toot
some more fixes to join/cjoin


*** 20001014_11 by toot
another fix to m_names call in m*_join


*** 20001014_10 by toot
. move add_vchan_to_client lower down, incase of bans etc in m_join
. hopefully m_names works now after /join #chan !id
. put a del_vchan_from_client in remove_user_from_channel


*** 20001014_9 by db
- fixed bug in add_vchan_to_client_cache, reversed two args while at it
- made m_privmsg message right channel 
- m_join also has to update cache



*** 20001014_8 by db
- added code to remove chan from client cache, not used yet
- added checks to ensure client doesn't join twice a subchan, not tested yet
- corrected conflict introduced by me
- added another macro for top level vchan detect



*** 20001014_7 by toot
. fixed typo in s_user.c
. made RPL_WHOISADMIN numeric consistent with dalnet
. changed a ->flags pointer that should have been ->umodes in m_whois


*** 20001014_6 by toot
forgot to change that parv to parc>2


*** 20001014_5 by toot
. don't allow CJOIN to a non-base channel
. don't list sub-channels if they try to /join a sub-channel's
  'long' name
. added an extra arg to m_names so it works after a CJOIN
  (there might be a better way to do this)


*** 20001014_4 by db
- moved show_vchans and find_vchan into vchannel.c



*** 20001014_3 by db
- mod Makefile.in to  add new vchannel.c
- added new vchannel.c for vchan support
- added new vchannel.h for vchan support
- added vchan cache call in m_cjoin.c



*** 20001014_2 by db
- m_names() after cjoin (toot)



*** 20001014_1 by db
- fixed cjoin so you actually look like you are joining the subchan now



*** 20001013_3 by db
- numeric 247 (uptime) got trashed in table. (HOW?) would cause server
  to core on /stats u



*** 20001013_2 by db
- cleaner sub1 fix for vchans



*** 20001013_1 by bill

Added null chptr checking to set_channel_modes()


*** 20001012_2 by db
- fixed bug in sub1_from_channel for vchans



*** 20001012_1 by db
- folded in work toot (Toby Verrall) to7@antipope.fsnet.co.uk
  did for first rough proof of concept vchans. We'll have to go in and
  #ifdef these later.



*** 20001011_1 by lusky
fix for *@*.foo.com I:lines being broken by a user@host.foo.com I:lines
change chptr->vchans to chptr->vchan_flag in channel.c to get this tree
  to compile.  not sure if this is correct.


*** 20001006_4 by db
Make virtual channels doubly linked.



*** 20001006_3 by lusky

 changed "juping locally" to "locally juping" (gp)
 typo in stats z display (gp)
 typo in channel jupe oper notice (db)
 new config.h option ALLOW_DOT_IN_IDENT


*** 20001003_1 by db

*** 20000930_1 by db
- started adding VCHAN code. I



*** 20000929_1 by ejb
merged toot's patch to resync with -6rc4

*** 20000926_1 by ejb
- added myself to core team list in version.c.SH
- added ircnet's +I invite exceptions
- remove {add,del}_*id(), replaced with a single function
  add_id and del_id, removes code duplication.
- added seperate error_sents for +I and +d in channel.c.
- removed some false BAN_INFO ifdefs



*** 20000907_1 by ejb
initial stab at IPv6 .. it doesn't compile with IPV6 defined yet..



*** 20000813_1 by ejb
Large commit, folding in a number of changes i made over the weekend.
- add n!u@h for topic_info ala ircnet.
- stats p notice.
- removed some old non-TS cruft.
- unreg users can't send version.
- added +a umode, shows oper is admin in whois 
  if they are 'admin=yes'.
- users can see the topic of a -s channel they aren't
  on (but can't set it even if it is -t, to prevent
  topic floods *sigh*)
- many changes in parse.c .. fixed a few bugs, rewrote
  the argument parser code, added support for catching
  users passing not enough parms before the m_ function
  is even called.
- you can now set in ircd.conf whether channels have to
  be +i for an invite to work.
- added a numeric (504) for sending to users trying to
  invite remote users to +i channels.
- started changing m_* functions to not check parc anymore,
  in most cases parse() has already handled this.
- move glines from config.h to ircd.conf
plus a lot of other stuff i probably forgot.



*** 20000731_1 by db
- Added Pie-Man changes, added him to list of contributors

 Fix for % in user's ident bug


*** 20000407_1 by db
- unused variable never caught, uneeded va_end caused solaris compiler
  to not compile



*** 20000405_1 by db
- committing some quick hacks for verifying block allocator
  is not leaking.
  These should be #ifdef'ed perhaps in future.
  when an oper does /stats $
  four files will be written to DPATH
  which will contain hex values of allocated memory for each client

  local_block_allocator_client_list.txt from block allocator
  local_client_list.txt                 from link list

  remote_block_allocator_client_list.txt from block allocator
  remote_client_list.txt                 from link list

  code external to the ircd is needed to verify consistency



*** 20000404_2 by db
- clean ups to parser



*** 20000404_1 by db
- fixed memory leak in parser code. strdup in lexer never freed
  found by Krome from ircnet



*** 20000402_10 by db
- MAX_SETBACK_TIME added



*** 20000402_9 by db

- updated config.h.dist to match config.h



*** 20000402_2 by db
- Pointed out by "is" with non standard p vs. s this else if is wrong
  "is" <ejb@debian.org>



*** 20000402_1 by db
- This bug caused only the first connection in a class to be tried
  i.e. if you had several C: lines in one =class= only the first
  C: line was ever used. This is code that was #ifdef'd out from original
  hybrid-5                    



*** 20000401_1 by db
- removal of #define kludge for GlobalSetOptions



*** 20000330_1 by db
- large resync , folding in a number of changes contributed by is
  This moves some config.h items into the conf file



*** 20000319_1 by lusky
Changed my email address, this is a test commit (jrl)


*** 20000209_1 by db

*** 20000201_1 by db
- converted separate user/host forms to user="user@host.part"; forms
  it looks nicer, and easier for admins to work with I think. Plus recommended
  by the #coder-com crew. ok.
- fixed stupid in initconf where it missed # commented out lines and
  tried to parse old format as new...
- folded in the old -5 nick collide code already folded into the -6 tree.
  its #ifdef'ed for future fixes...



*** 20000131_1 by db
- improvements to connect section. allow multiple hub_masks etc.



*** 20000124_3 by db
- first work on logging section, 
  logging level can be set from new conf file format now.



*** 20000124_2 by db
- updated convertconf



*** 20000124_1 by db
- removed #ifdef for ZIP_LINKS
  I hate #ifdef's



*** 20000123_2 by db
- added fbunputc mimics unputc (Sorry Tom)
- single conf file, is either old style or new style determined
  at initconf time (Again, sorry Tom)
  Could have done it simpler, but this is safer for now...



*** 20000123_1 by db
- cleaned up some "bare" 512 defines. added new IRCD_BUFSIZE define
- added better error recovery to parser, 
- added better error reporting.
- tentative new conf format mostly finished, will "warp" it a bit
  more to match Kev's proposed format as possible, given undernet vs.
  efnet differences..
- need to handle ircd.conf form as the new format as default,
  and fall back to old format as needed. i.e. kludge code still to 
  be removed in source...



*** 20000122_1 by db
- more cleanup on new conf file parser..
  using "auth" instead of "client" as per Kev's document..



*** 20000121_1 by db
- preliminary serverinfo section done



*** 20000120_1 by db
- CONNECT in new parser works, needs full testing



*** 20000117_3 by db
- added a few more sections



*** 20000117_2 by db
- Added quarantine



*** 20000117_1 by db
- continuing with new parser code... listen/operator tested



*** 20000116_7 by db
- bunch of changes in order to have class names not numbers. *sigh*
  I toyed with the idea of keeping class #'s and having class_names
  to class #' mapping somewhere, but thats just getting silly.. sooo....
  Here we are...



*** 20000116_6 by db
- make_class should return a 0'ed class to be safe



*** 20000116_5 by db
- prelim. change before I start on class names



*** 20000116_4 by db
- oper section complete except for class operations..



*** 20000116_3 by db
- checkpoint with operator section mostly working...
  class code has to be rewritten still



*** 20000116_2 by db
- oops. I changed Makefile rather than Makefile.in



*** 20000116_1 by db
- copyright touch ups
- missing -ll in Makefile



*** 20000115_3 by db
- The lex/yacc files...



*** 20000115_2 by db
- first very rough working lex/yacc under ircd-hybrid..
  parser doesn't actually do anything.... yet...
  Tom, we could use a fileio pushback, to push back a line thats
  "not for us"



*** 20000115_1 by db
- more cleanups to parse code



*** 20000113_3 by db
- someone forgot to add a file. wonder who



*** 20000113_2 by db
- externalized the old parser, unfortunately, this means a lot
  more of the s_conf interface is visible ;-(, can do better in the future...
  This is in preparation for new parser inclusion.
  This will (ick) allow us to use both old conf files and new format conf files
  for backwards compatibility. (I'm not terribly happy about this, but...
  Hi Tom!)



*** 20000113_1 by db
- updated client/deny sections to use new IP_TYPE
- fixed union to use struct ip_value



*** 20000112_1 by db
- returned to ';' at end of each section, this is actually easier to
  recover from errors; just scan for ';'
- updated convertconf to produce test file
- added IP token to lexer and to client section



*** 20000111_11 by db
- added DENY 



*** 20000111_10 by db
- more work on yacc/lex parser
  added "kill" open to discussion, but efnet has "K" and "D" lines
  


*** 20000111_9 by db
- changes to bring it into line with Kev's sample conf just a tiny bit
- removed that dumb ';' at end of sections



*** 20000111_8 by db
- tiny cleanup to Makefile
  Copyright notice fixed 



*** 20000111_7 by db
- added preliminary yacc/lex test parser code



*** 20000111_6 by db
Directory /usr/hybrid/ircd-hybrid-7/src/test/newconf added to the repository


*** 20000111_5 by db
- oops port in connect was quoted



*** 20000111_4 by db
- more tiny tweaks



*** 20000111_3 by db
- tweaks to new conf format



*** 20000111_2 by db
- sample ircd.conf and its converted ircd.conf.new 



*** 20000111_1 by db
- Now pretty much handles a "normal" conf file.. output is
  a "new" style conf format file, with details still to be hashed out.
  Do we want to handle multiple C/N's ? multiple H lines? *sigh* yes
  Thats next, but not yet.
 


*** 20000110_4 by db
- tiny tweak much more to do



*** 20000110_3 by db
- Nearly done. TODO Finish off I lines (I line prefixes)
  HUB or LEAF control set in old M line



*** 20000110_2 by db
- updated Makefile, fleshed out convertconf more



*** 20000110_1 by db
- small cleanup to s_conf.c before the bigger one



*** 20000109_12 by wnder
woopsies


*** 20000109_11 by wnder
Added documentation of the iauth protocol


*** 20000109_10 by db
- bit more fleshing out of convertconf.c



*** 20000109_9 by db
- first rough outline of conversion program to convert old style
  to new style conf file format. No Makefile, incomplete still.



*** 20000109_8 by db
- more cleanups, made consistent... no need for MSG_PRIVMSG/MSG_NOTICE
  other m_ files don't do that



*** 20000109_7 by db
- cleanups



*** 20000109_6 by db
- m_mode bursts/looks for channel mode on uplink in LazyLinks code



*** 20000109_5 by db
- removed uneeded #include



*** 20000109_4 by db
- forgot to remove now unused m_message.c



*** 20000109_3 by db
- split m_privmsg and m_notice into two files. My rationale for doing this
  is: slightly faster, no more if(notice) in code, m_privmsg/m_notice
  rarely change anyway.



*** 20000109_2 by wnder
Added support for when SerialNumber rolls over to 0


*** 20000109_1 by db
- as fbgets is re-entrant, redid .include code. Much nicer



*** 20000108_5 by wnder
Implemented serial number method to keep track of searched nodes.
(hi diane!!)


*** 20000108_4 by db
- LazyLinks /list on leaf is sent to its uplink now
- still bug to track down with leaf connected to hub, hub joins net
  leaf does not see channel bursts properly



*** 20000108_3 by wnder
Implemented unsortable I/K lines


*** 20000108_2 by db
- still slowly working in LazyLinks version 2 code. nick collides
  have to be handled by the LazyLinks uplink, for now sending back
  KILL's (which were removed!) as needed...



*** 20000108_1 by wnder
fixed missing #include "s_conf.h"


*** 20000107_4 by db
- sticky / key



*** 20000107_3 by db
- don't core if chptr == NULL in sendto_match_servs()
  shouldn't normally ever happen, but does in LL 



*** 20000107_2 by db
- closer version of LazyLinks version 2



*** 20000107_1 by db
- split out m_user.c m_nick.c, modified s_user.c s_user.h Makefile.in
  LazyLinks is in unworkable state in this version.



*** 20000106_1 by db
- fixed bug introduced in ReplaceQuotes, '\#' was not handled correctly.



*** 20000105_16 by db
- all over the place



*** 20000105_15 by db
- yet another hidden HUB in .h



*** 20000105_14 by db
- removed more pesky #ifdef HUB hidden in .h files



*** 20000105_13 by db
- always initialize serverMask



*** 20000105_12 by db
- HUB removed, server determines if its HUB or LEAF by looking
  at (Now unused) port line in M line. If its a 1, its a HUB, if
  its missing or anything else, its a LEAF.
  Can be queried from /admin
  Yes, its a hack for now.



*** 20000105_11 by db
- removed HUB from config.h etc. now in a config entry



*** 20000105_10 by db
- allow single dot in user names to allow for "first.last" user name style



*** 20000105_9 by db
- removed unneeded include



*** 20000105_8 by db
- oops. missed comment in m_lljoin.c



*** 20000105_7 by db
- oops. removed comments belonging to channel.c only



*** 20000105_6 by db
- committing the split out m_cburst.c m_drop.c m_lljoin.c



*** 20000105_5 by db
- split out m_drop.c m_cburst.c m_lljoin.c



*** 20000105_4 by db
- further cleanups to s_conf.c



*** 20000105_3 by db
- Further cleanups to s_conf.c



*** 20000105_2 by db
- fixed missing Y line detection code which got broken in clean up



*** 20000105_1 by db
- cleanups to dbuf code. Try to flush connections if dbuf list is
  empty then try to allocate.
- tiny start on new channel hierarchy scheme.



*** 20000104_6 by wnder
Prettied up source files by converting tabs to spaces


*** 20000104_5 by db
- fixed DEBUG error in s_conf.c



*** 20000104_4 by db
- also report how many malloc()'ed dbufs there were max



*** 20000104_3 by db
- changed slightly wording in LazyLinks As Implemented doc
- removed more DEBUGLL debug cruft
- simplified m_join CBURST call



*** 20000104_2 by db
- added "Lazy Links As Implemented in Hybrid" doc



*** 20000104_1 by db
- removed more #ifdef's removed BAN_INFO BAN_UH



*** 20000103_7 by db
- mods to try to flush connections if dbufs are used up



*** 20000103_6 by db
- it all works now (LL). channel cleanup etc. 



*** 20000103_5 by db
- this version doesn't core as often. *sigh*
  cleanup channels code needs to be gone over again, its stable
  without.
- removed some cruft and useless comments from client.c



*** 20000103_4 by db
- *sigh* code got lost in the shuffle
  fix stats c so n lines show as n not N
  fix spacing on 333 numeric to match others




*** 20000103_3 by db
- removed last vestige of TOPIC_WHO define



*** 20000103_2 by db
- fixed a typo in ircd.c



*** 20000103_1 by db
- Folded in Perly's cleanup channel code. The idea is to remove
  channels from the lazylinks leaf server if no local members are on them
  and they haven't been used by anyone locally in a "while" where
  "while" is set in s_serv.h CLEANUP_CHANNELS_TIME seconds.
  I've redone the destroy channel code. It should work, but its untested.
  CLEANUP_CHANNELS_TIME is set way low still for debugging,
  its currently 30 seconds. In production it could range from 15 to 60 minutes
  I'd guess.



*** 20000102_9 by db
- key handling was broken in m_cburst



*** 20000102_8 by db
- oops got an if backwards key when NULL cores it

SYNs on the primary port and killing poll performance.


*** 19991013_9 by lusky
fixed m_ison to put trailing space on 303 responses
CONNECTFAST is always defined for USE_POLL now, was causing very poor

*** 19991011_1 by db
  It turns out, that cptr->fd is <0 in some cases when its being used, just
as Q described. I was confused at first, because it sounded like he
was saying cptr was =freed= then being used. It appears its still a valid
pointer, but its fd has been closed...

  The ideal solution would be to make sure the cptr is removed from the 
channel link list before the code even gets to sendto_common_channels()

  In any case, using an fd < 0 in this section is a BAD THING 



*** 19991009_1 by db
- better fix for umode code



*** 19990925_1 by db
- simpler mode letter to bit mask table lookup, safer



*** 19990924_2 by db
- yet another ->name instead of ->user this one in report_tklines



*** 19990924_1 by db

*** 19990909_1 by wnder
Ok, sorry for the broken compile - I put all the iauth code

ircd needs these changes to work with iauth - as of right now,
ircd attempts a connection to 127.0.0.1 port 4444 where it
expects the IAuth server to be - you just need to run
-7/iauth/source/iauth first so it listens on 4444. In the future,
the iauth host/port will be dynamically configurable.


*** 19990902_4 by wnder
ident support

answer of the form: DoneAuth <ID> <username> <hostname>.

Changed MyFree to automatically set the pointer to zero after freeing it.
#define MyFree(x) do { if ((x)) { free((x)); (x) = 0; } while (0)
The assignment is cheap, and it should eliminate double free issues.
