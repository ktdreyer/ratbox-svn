*** 20000103_6 by db
- it all works now (LL). channel cleanup etc. 



*** 20000103_5 by db
- this version doesn't core as often. *sigh*
  cleanup channels code needs to be gone over again, its stable
  without.
- removed some cruft and useless comments from client.c



*** 20000103_4 by db
- *sigh* code got lost in the shuffle
  fix stats c so n lines show as n not N
  fix spacing on 333 numeric to match others




*** 20000103_3 by db
- removed last vestige of TOPIC_WHO define



*** 20000103_2 by db
- fixed a typo in ircd.c



*** 20000103_1 by db
- Folded in Perly's cleanup channel code. The idea is to remove
  channels from the lazylinks leaf server if no local members are on them
  and they haven't been used by anyone locally in a "while" where
  "while" is set in s_serv.h CLEANUP_CHANNELS_TIME seconds.
  I've redone the destroy channel code. It should work, but its untested.
  CLEANUP_CHANNELS_TIME is set way low still for debugging,
  its currently 30 seconds. In production it could range from 15 to 60 minutes
  I'd guess.



*** 20000102_9 by db
- key handling was broken in m_cburst



*** 20000102_8 by db
- oops got an if backwards key when NULL cores it



*** 20000102_7 by db
- try to negotiate a non LL connect if serverMask's get all used up
- report all serverMask's used up. That will mean a recode ;-)



*** 20000102_6 by db
- fixed a bug in m_join.c
- cleaned up LL channel key handling
- don't assign serverMask's to non LL servers



*** 20000102_5 by db
- added LazyLinks.txt document outlining original Lazy Links protocol
  its been modified for -7
- ensure serverMask of 0 just causes restoreUnusedServerMask to return



*** 20000102_4 by db
- First working Lazy Links implementation
  still needs debugging/testing etc.



*** 20000102_3 by db
- bug reported by Colten Edwards in m_userhost.c



*** 20000102_2 by db
- oops bogus code in m_sjoin.c



*** 20000102_1 by db
- few tidy ups in prelim LL code



*** 20000101_4 by db
- implemented DROP, not tested, not used yet.



*** 20000101_3 by db
- Preliminary rough cut at Lazy Links, still a lot of mopping up to do
  'n' in c/n's means try lazy link, 'N' means do normal.



*** 20000101_2 by db
- Cleanups to allow DEBUGMODE to compile



*** 20000101_1 by db
- cleanup of LITTLE_I_LINES #ifdef



*** 19991231_4 by db
- renamed channel to GLobalChannelList in jupe channel code

- more cleanup of s_conf.c



*** 19991231_2 by db
- Preliminary cleanups on s_conf.c



*** 19991231_1 by db
- missing NULL assignment would cause double free's and eventual
  core on malformed U: lines.



*** 19991230_11 by wnder
more iauth fixups - this should finish it!


*** 19991230_10 by wnder
IAuth fixups


*** 19991230_9 by db
- oopsies in opcount code spotted by Perly.. flag has to be used
  before set...



*** 19991230_8 by db
- more missed updates local_cptr_list -> LocalClientList



*** 19991230_7 by db
- missed a opcount-- in m_sjoin.c
- missed an #endif for IAUTH



*** 19991230_6 by db
- Added chanop counter to Channel struct, keep track of current op count
  use instead of that nasty loop in SJOIN code



*** 19991230_5 by db
- folding back in USE_IAUTH code



*** 19991230_4 by db
- completion of mop up of resync with -6 tree. Compiles again



*** 19991230_3 by db
- mop up of resync of -7 with -6



*** 19991230_2 by db
- mop up -7 tree resync with -6

*** 19991217_1 by db
1) folded in d line fix from -6
2) folded in res.c core bug fix from -6



*** 19991109_1 by db
- changes to sendto_one_type to not send @# style of message to non
  CHW servers
- m_userhost old behaviour restored, but rewritten. Need to support
  up to 5 userhost requests, this fixes ircle clients which depend on
  this behaviour.



*** 19991022_1 by db
- disallow -ve limit on mode #channel +l 



*** 19991017_2 by db
- missing mask check in IP kline code. no idea why.



*** 19991017_1 by db
- removed (+) cruft as this was a Tanerism



*** 19991013_10 by tomh
Removed CONNECTFAST garbage, it was causing production boxes to load up on
SYNs on the primary port and killing poll performance.


*** 19991013_9 by lusky
fixed m_ison to put trailing space on 303 responses
CONNECTFAST is always defined for USE_POLL now, was causing very poor
  accept performance on heavily loaded non-Solaris machines using poll()


*** 19991013_8 by tomh
put USE_POLL back in setup.h.in, removed stuff that wasn't needed


*** 19991013_7 by lusky
syncd config.h.dist to config.h

- corrected table in s_log.c for log level to string



*** 19991013_2 by db
- added strings to m_set LOG



*** 19991013_1 by db
- botched wild card matching fixed



*** 19991011_1 by db
  It turns out, that cptr->fd is <0 in some cases when its being used, just
as Q described. I was confused at first, because it sounded like he
was saying cptr was =freed= then being used. It appears its still a valid
pointer, but its fd has been closed...

  The ideal solution would be to make sure the cptr is removed from the 
channel link list before the code even gets to sendto_common_channels()

  In any case, using an fd < 0 in this section is a BAD THING 



*** 19991009_1 by db
- better fix for umode code



*** 19990925_1 by db
- simpler mode letter to bit mask table lookup, safer



*** 19990924_2 by db
- yet another ->name instead of ->user this one in report_tklines



*** 19990924_1 by db
- This patch corrects a case where a normal user can oper themselves. oops.
- It also corrects a possible core due to a bogus H or L line. (neph)



*** 19990914_1 by wnder

add fd check to other #ifdef SENDQALWAYS


*** 19990910_6 by tomh

more #ifdef USE_IAUTH stuff


*** 19990909_1 by wnder
Ok, sorry for the broken compile - I put all the iauth code
in the ircd tree under #ifdef USE_IAUTH so hopefully nothing

*** 19990902_6 by wnder
oops


*** 19990902_5 by wnder
ircd needs these changes to work with iauth - as of right now,
ircd attempts a connection to 127.0.0.1 port 4444 where it
expects the IAuth server to be - you just need to run
-7/iauth/source/iauth first so it listens on 4444. In the future,
the iauth host/port will be dynamically configurable.


*** 19990902_4 by wnder
ident support

queries of the form: DoAuth <ID> <ip address> and returns an
answer of the form: DoneAuth <ID> <username> <hostname>.
Ident/DNS have not been completed yet.

Changed MyFree to automatically set the pointer to zero after freeing it.
#define MyFree(x) do { if ((x)) { free((x)); (x) = 0; } while (0)
The assignment is cheap, and it should eliminate double free issues.
