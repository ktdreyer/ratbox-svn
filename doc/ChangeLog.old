Changed my email address, this is a test commit (jrl)


*** 20000209_1 by db
- fixed goof with removing of an #ifdef for TOPIC_INFO 
  patch done by is- 



*** 20000201_3 by db
- synced up convertconf to current parser format



*** 20000201_2 by tomh

Fix UMR picked up by purify:
****  Purify instrumented ircd (pid 11725)  ****
UMR: Uninitialized memory read (15 times):
  * This is occurring while in:
        read_message   [s_bsd.c:909]
        main           [ircd.c:688]
        _start         [crt1.o]
  * Reading 4 bytes from 0xefffe5ac on the stack.
  * Address 0xefffe5ac is local variable "poll_fds" in function read_message.



*** 20000201_1 by db
- converted separate user/host forms to user="user@host.part"; forms
  it looks nicer, and easier for admins to work with I think. Plus recommended
  by the #coder-com crew. ok.
- fixed stupid in initconf where it missed # commented out lines and
  tried to parse old format as new...
- folded in the old -5 nick collide code already folded into the -6 tree.
  its #ifdef'ed for future fixes...



*** 20000131_1 by db
- improvements to connect section. allow multiple hub_masks etc.



*** 20000124_3 by db
- first work on logging section, 
  logging level can be set from new conf file format now.



*** 20000124_2 by db
- updated convertconf



*** 20000124_1 by db
- removed #ifdef for ZIP_LINKS
  I hate #ifdef's



*** 20000123_2 by db
- added fbunputc mimics unputc (Sorry Tom)
- single conf file, is either old style or new style determined
  at initconf time (Again, sorry Tom)
  Could have done it simpler, but this is safer for now...



*** 20000123_1 by db
- cleaned up some "bare" 512 defines. added new IRCD_BUFSIZE define
- added better error recovery to parser, 
- added better error reporting.
- tentative new conf format mostly finished, will "warp" it a bit
  more to match Kev's proposed format as possible, given undernet vs.
  efnet differences..
- need to handle ircd.conf form as the new format as default,
  and fall back to old format as needed. i.e. kludge code still to 
  be removed in source...



*** 20000122_1 by db
- more cleanup on new conf file parser..
  using "auth" instead of "client" as per Kev's document..



*** 20000121_1 by db
- preliminary serverinfo section done



*** 20000120_1 by db
- CONNECT in new parser works, needs full testing



*** 20000117_3 by db
- added a few more sections



*** 20000117_2 by db
- Added quarantine



*** 20000117_1 by db
- continuing with new parser code... listen/operator tested



*** 20000116_7 by db
- bunch of changes in order to have class names not numbers. *sigh*
  I toyed with the idea of keeping class #'s and having class_names
  to class #' mapping somewhere, but thats just getting silly.. sooo....
  Here we are...



*** 20000116_6 by db
- make_class should return a 0'ed class to be safe



*** 20000116_5 by db
- prelim. change before I start on class names



*** 20000116_4 by db
- oper section complete except for class operations..



*** 20000116_3 by db
- checkpoint with operator section mostly working...
  class code has to be rewritten still



*** 20000116_2 by db
- oops. I changed Makefile rather than Makefile.in



*** 20000116_1 by db
- copyright touch ups
- missing -ll in Makefile



*** 20000115_3 by db
- The lex/yacc files...



*** 20000115_2 by db
- first very rough working lex/yacc under ircd-hybrid..
  parser doesn't actually do anything.... yet...
  Tom, we could use a fileio pushback, to push back a line thats
  "not for us"



*** 20000115_1 by db
- more cleanups to parse code



*** 20000113_3 by db
- someone forgot to add a file. wonder who



*** 20000113_2 by db
- externalized the old parser, unfortunately, this means a lot
  more of the s_conf interface is visible ;-(, can do better in the future...
  This is in preparation for new parser inclusion.
  This will (ick) allow us to use both old conf files and new format conf files
  for backwards compatibility. (I'm not terribly happy about this, but...
  Hi Tom!)



*** 20000113_1 by db
- updated client/deny sections to use new IP_TYPE
- fixed union to use struct ip_value



*** 20000112_1 by db
- returned to ';' at end of each section, this is actually easier to
  recover from errors; just scan for ';'
- updated convertconf to produce test file
- added IP token to lexer and to client section



*** 20000111_11 by db
- added DENY 



*** 20000111_10 by db
- more work on yacc/lex parser
  added "kill" open to discussion, but efnet has "K" and "D" lines
  


*** 20000111_9 by db
- changes to bring it into line with Kev's sample conf just a tiny bit
- removed that dumb ';' at end of sections



*** 20000111_8 by db
- tiny cleanup to Makefile
  Copyright notice fixed 



*** 20000111_7 by db
- added preliminary yacc/lex test parser code



*** 20000111_6 by db
Directory /usr/hybrid/ircd-hybrid-7/src/test/newconf added to the repository


*** 20000111_5 by db
- oops port in connect was quoted



*** 20000111_4 by db
- more tiny tweaks



*** 20000111_3 by db
- tweaks to new conf format



*** 20000111_2 by db
- sample ircd.conf and its converted ircd.conf.new 



*** 20000111_1 by db
- Now pretty much handles a "normal" conf file.. output is
  a "new" style conf format file, with details still to be hashed out.
  Do we want to handle multiple C/N's ? multiple H lines? *sigh* yes
  Thats next, but not yet.
 


*** 20000110_4 by db
- tiny tweak much more to do



*** 20000110_3 by db
- Nearly done. TODO Finish off I lines (I line prefixes)
  HUB or LEAF control set in old M line



*** 20000110_2 by db
- updated Makefile, fleshed out convertconf more



*** 20000110_1 by db
- small cleanup to s_conf.c before the bigger one



*** 20000109_12 by wnder
woopsies


*** 20000109_11 by wnder
Added documentation of the iauth protocol


*** 20000109_10 by db
- bit more fleshing out of convertconf.c



*** 20000109_9 by db
- first rough outline of conversion program to convert old style
  to new style conf file format. No Makefile, incomplete still.



*** 20000109_8 by db
- more cleanups, made consistent... no need for MSG_PRIVMSG/MSG_NOTICE
  other m_ files don't do that



*** 20000109_7 by db
- cleanups



*** 20000109_6 by db
- m_mode bursts/looks for channel mode on uplink in LazyLinks code



*** 20000109_5 by db
- removed uneeded #include



*** 20000109_4 by db
- forgot to remove now unused m_message.c



*** 20000109_3 by db
- split m_privmsg and m_notice into two files. My rationale for doing this
  is: slightly faster, no more if(notice) in code, m_privmsg/m_notice
  rarely change anyway.



*** 20000109_2 by wnder
Added support for when SerialNumber rolls over to 0


*** 20000109_1 by db
- as fbgets is re-entrant, redid .include code. Much nicer



*** 20000108_5 by wnder
Implemented serial number method to keep track of searched nodes.
(hi diane!!)


*** 20000108_4 by db
- LazyLinks /list on leaf is sent to its uplink now
- still bug to track down with leaf connected to hub, hub joins net
  leaf does not see channel bursts properly



*** 20000108_3 by wnder
Implemented unsortable I/K lines


*** 20000108_2 by db
- still slowly working in LazyLinks version 2 code. nick collides
  have to be handled by the LazyLinks uplink, for now sending back
  KILL's (which were removed!) as needed...



*** 20000108_1 by wnder
fixed missing #include "s_conf.h"


*** 20000107_4 by db
- sticky / key



*** 20000107_3 by db
- don't core if chptr == NULL in sendto_match_servs()
  shouldn't normally ever happen, but does in LL 



*** 20000107_2 by db
- closer version of LazyLinks version 2



*** 20000107_1 by db
- split out m_user.c m_nick.c, modified s_user.c s_user.h Makefile.in
  LazyLinks is in unworkable state in this version.



*** 20000106_1 by db
- fixed bug introduced in ReplaceQuotes, '\#' was not handled correctly.



*** 20000105_16 by db
- all over the place



*** 20000105_15 by db
- yet another hidden HUB in .h



*** 20000105_14 by db
- removed more pesky #ifdef HUB hidden in .h files



*** 20000105_13 by db
- always initialize serverMask



*** 20000105_12 by db
- HUB removed, server determines if its HUB or LEAF by looking
  at (Now unused) port line in M line. If its a 1, its a HUB, if
  its missing or anything else, its a LEAF.
  Can be queried from /admin
  Yes, its a hack for now.



*** 20000105_11 by db
- removed HUB from config.h etc. now in a config entry



*** 20000105_10 by db
- allow single dot in user names to allow for "first.last" user name style



*** 20000105_9 by db
- removed unneeded include



*** 20000105_8 by db
- oops. missed comment in m_lljoin.c



*** 20000105_7 by db
- oops. removed comments belonging to channel.c only



*** 20000105_6 by db
- committing the split out m_cburst.c m_drop.c m_lljoin.c



*** 20000105_5 by db
- split out m_drop.c m_cburst.c m_lljoin.c



*** 20000105_4 by db
- further cleanups to s_conf.c



*** 20000105_3 by db
- Further cleanups to s_conf.c



*** 20000105_2 by db
- fixed missing Y line detection code which got broken in clean up



*** 20000105_1 by db
- cleanups to dbuf code. Try to flush connections if dbuf list is
  empty then try to allocate.
- tiny start on new channel hierarchy scheme.



*** 20000104_6 by wnder
Prettied up source files by converting tabs to spaces


*** 20000104_5 by db
- fixed DEBUG error in s_conf.c



*** 20000104_4 by db
- also report how many malloc()'ed dbufs there were max



*** 20000104_3 by db
- changed slightly wording in LazyLinks As Implemented doc
- removed more DEBUGLL debug cruft
- simplified m_join CBURST call



*** 20000104_2 by db
- added "Lazy Links As Implemented in Hybrid" doc



*** 20000104_1 by db
- removed more #ifdef's removed BAN_INFO BAN_UH



*** 20000103_7 by db
- mods to try to flush connections if dbufs are used up



*** 20000103_6 by db
- it all works now (LL). channel cleanup etc. 



*** 20000103_5 by db
- this version doesn't core as often. *sigh*
  cleanup channels code needs to be gone over again, its stable
  without.
- removed some cruft and useless comments from client.c



*** 20000103_4 by db
- *sigh* code got lost in the shuffle
  fix stats c so n lines show as n not N
  fix spacing on 333 numeric to match others




*** 20000103_3 by db
- removed last vestige of TOPIC_WHO define



*** 20000103_2 by db
- fixed a typo in ircd.c



*** 20000103_1 by db
- Folded in Perly's cleanup channel code. The idea is to remove
  channels from the lazylinks leaf server if no local members are on them
  and they haven't been used by anyone locally in a "while" where
  "while" is set in s_serv.h CLEANUP_CHANNELS_TIME seconds.
  I've redone the destroy channel code. It should work, but its untested.
  CLEANUP_CHANNELS_TIME is set way low still for debugging,
  its currently 30 seconds. In production it could range from 15 to 60 minutes
  I'd guess.



*** 20000102_9 by db
- key handling was broken in m_cburst



*** 20000102_8 by db
- oops got an if backwards key when NULL cores it



*** 20000102_7 by db
- try to negotiate a non LL connect if serverMask's get all used up
- report all serverMask's used up. That will mean a recode ;-)



*** 20000102_6 by db
- fixed a bug in m_join.c
- cleaned up LL channel key handling
- don't assign serverMask's to non LL servers



*** 20000102_5 by db
- added LazyLinks.txt document outlining original Lazy Links protocol
  its been modified for -7
- ensure serverMask of 0 just causes restoreUnusedServerMask to return



*** 20000102_4 by db
- First working Lazy Links implementation
  still needs debugging/testing etc.



*** 20000102_3 by db
- bug reported by Colten Edwards in m_userhost.c



*** 20000102_2 by db
- oops bogus code in m_sjoin.c



*** 20000102_1 by db
- few tidy ups in prelim LL code



*** 20000101_4 by db
- implemented DROP, not tested, not used yet.



*** 20000101_3 by db
- Preliminary rough cut at Lazy Links, still a lot of mopping up to do
  'n' in c/n's means try lazy link, 'N' means do normal.



*** 20000101_2 by db
- Cleanups to allow DEBUGMODE to compile



*** 20000101_1 by db
- cleanup of LITTLE_I_LINES #ifdef



*** 19991231_4 by db
- renamed channel to GLobalChannelList in jupe channel code



*** 19991231_3 by db
- more cleanup of s_conf.c



*** 19991231_2 by db
- Preliminary cleanups on s_conf.c



*** 19991231_1 by db
- missing NULL assignment would cause double free's and eventual
  core on malformed U: lines.



*** 19991230_11 by wnder
more iauth fixups - this should finish it!


*** 19991230_10 by wnder
IAuth fixups


*** 19991230_9 by db
- oopsies in opcount code spotted by Perly.. flag has to be used
  before set...



*** 19991230_8 by db
- more missed updates local_cptr_list -> LocalClientList



*** 19991230_7 by db
- missed a opcount-- in m_sjoin.c
- missed an #endif for IAUTH



*** 19991230_6 by db
- Added chanop counter to Channel struct, keep track of current op count
  use instead of that nasty loop in SJOIN code



*** 19991230_5 by db
- folding back in USE_IAUTH code



*** 19991230_4 by db
- completion of mop up of resync with -6 tree. Compiles again



*** 19991230_3 by db
- mop up of resync of -7 with -6



*** 19991230_2 by db
- mop up -7 tree resync with -6



*** 19991230_1 by db
resync with current ircd-hybrid-6 tree



*** 19991217_1 by db
1) folded in d line fix from -6
2) folded in res.c core bug fix from -6



*** 19991109_1 by db
- changes to sendto_one_type to not send @# style of message to non
  CHW servers
- m_userhost old behaviour restored, but rewritten. Need to support
  up to 5 userhost requests, this fixes ircle clients which depend on
  this behaviour.



*** 19991022_1 by db
- disallow -ve limit on mode #channel +l 



*** 19991017_2 by db
- missing mask check in IP kline code. no idea why.



*** 19991017_1 by db
- removed (+) cruft as this was a Tanerism



*** 19991013_10 by tomh
Removed CONNECTFAST garbage, it was causing production boxes to load up on
SYNs on the primary port and killing poll performance.


*** 19991013_9 by lusky
fixed m_ison to put trailing space on 303 responses
CONNECTFAST is always defined for USE_POLL now, was causing very poor
  accept performance on heavily loaded non-Solaris machines using poll()


*** 19991013_8 by tomh
put USE_POLL back in setup.h.in, removed stuff that wasn't needed


*** 19991013_7 by lusky
syncd config.h.dist to config.h


*** 19991013_6 by wnder
missing macros


*** 19991013_5 by lusky
updated opers.txt to include set log


*** 19991013_4 by db
- fixed misnomer



*** 19991013_3 by db
- corrected table in s_log.c for log level to string



*** 19991013_2 by db
- added strings to m_set LOG



*** 19991013_1 by db
- botched wild card matching fixed



*** 19991011_1 by db
  It turns out, that cptr->fd is <0 in some cases when its being used, just
as Q described. I was confused at first, because it sounded like he
was saying cptr was =freed= then being used. It appears its still a valid
pointer, but its fd has been closed...

  The ideal solution would be to make sure the cptr is removed from the 
channel link list before the code even gets to sendto_common_channels()

  In any case, using an fd < 0 in this section is a BAD THING 



*** 19991009_1 by db
- better fix for umode code



*** 19990925_1 by db
- simpler mode letter to bit mask table lookup, safer



*** 19990924_2 by db
- yet another ->name instead of ->user this one in report_tklines



*** 19990924_1 by db
- This patch corrects a case where a normal user can oper themselves. oops.
- It also corrects a possible core due to a bogus H or L line. (neph)



*** 19990914_1 by wnder
IAuth updates:
 * mtree.c is (hopefully) approaching it's final stages - much
   more bulletproof now.


*** 19990913_1 by wnder
IAuth updates:
 * added a new mtree module - handles I: and K: lines. Please
   throw all sorts of odd combinations at it to give it a good
   run - highly experimental :-)

add fd check to other #ifdef SENDQALWAYS


*** 19990910_6 by tomh

*** 19990909_2 by wnder
more #ifdef USE_IAUTH stuff


*** 19990909_1 by wnder
Ok, sorry for the broken compile - I put all the iauth code
in the ircd tree under #ifdef USE_IAUTH so hopefully nothing
else will be affected until it's good and ready - i'll do a
checkout after this to make sure everything's fine.

ircd needs these changes to work with iauth - as of right now,
ircd attempts a connection to 127.0.0.1 port 4444 where it
expects the IAuth server to be - you just need to run
-7/iauth/source/iauth first so it listens on 4444. In the future,
the iauth host/port will be dynamically configurable.


*** 19990902_4 by wnder
ident support


*** 19990902_3 by wnder
minor fix
