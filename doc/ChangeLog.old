*** 19990909_1 by wnder
Ok, sorry for the broken compile - I put all the iauth code
in the ircd tree under #ifdef USE_IAUTH so hopefully nothing

checkout after this to make sure everything's fine.

ircd needs these changes to work with iauth - as of right now,
ircd attempts a connection to 127.0.0.1 port 4444 where it
expects the IAuth server to be - you just need to run
-7/iauth/source/iauth first so it listens on 4444. In the future,
the iauth host/port will be dynamically configurable.

Changed MyFree to automatically set the pointer to zero after freeing it.
