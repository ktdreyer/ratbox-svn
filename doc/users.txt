NO PARAMETERS:
--------------

     +n     - 'No external messages'.  This will prevent any user who
              isnt in the channel from sending messages to the channel.

     +t     - 'Ops Topic'.  This will prevent any user who isnt opped,
              or halfopped (+o/+h) from setting a channel topic.

     +s     - 'Secret'.  This will prevent the channel from being shown
              in a /whois, and in the channel list.

     +p     - 'Private'.  

     +m     - 'Moderated'.  This will prevent any user who isnt opped,
              halfopped or voiced (+o/+h/+v) from talking in the channel.

     +a     - 'Anonymous ops'.  This will stop people who join from
              seeing who has ops.  Any modes set in the channel will
              be shown as if a server set them.

              When a user becomes opped or halfopped (+o/+h) they will
              receive an op sync, where the server will op every user
              that is opped.  They will then see modes normally, and
              have the true list of who has ops/halfops/voices

     +i     - 'Invite only'.  This will stop anyone from joining your
              channel who hasnt received an /invite or whos host isnt in
