			    kline 
                            =====


  kline has been extended to add remote server klines, this is an extension
of the original hybrid-6 concept of server shared mode which allowed a hub
and leaf to share klines, locops etc. 

  In this implementation, it is extended to be routable among servers which
understand the "KLN" capability. This allows us to continue to "talk"
to non remote kline capable servers without breaking anything. This keeps
us completely EFnet compatible.

  Oper usage:

  Oper wishes to place a permament kline on user@host giving reason for kline.

  /quote kline [nick|user@host]   :reason

  Oper wishes to place a temporary kline (tkline) time in minutes is
  given as 'n'. 

  /quote kline n [nick|user@host] :reason


  For a remote kline
  Oper wishes to kline user@host on server irc.xyz.net

  /quote kline [nick|user@host] ON irc.xyz.net :reason

  and the tkline version

  /quote kline n [nick|user@host] on irc.xyz.net :reason

  
  For a network wide kline

  /quote kline [nick|user@host] on * :reason

  and the tkline version

  /quote kline n [nick|user@host] on * :reason


  Note, in all the remote cases, the originating server must be
put into shared{} block(s) in ircd.conf. (see example.conf in this directory
for full information)

   shared {
          name = "this.server.net";

# optional limit on user@host for oper
          user = "db";
          host = "db.net";
   };           



Server to Server Protocol
=========================

  As mentioned above, each server capable of remote klines passes
the capability KLN along. No server will send a KLINE to a server
without a KLN capability.

  Server to server messages are formatted like this:


  ":server.prefix KLINE oper target.server.name N user host :reason"
    
  Note the difference between hybrid-6 GLINE which explicitly passed
the oper user@host and server along. This was originally done to handle
possible desync conditions, but is now shelved in favour of saving 
some bandwidth.


   oper is the nick of the oper placing the kline

   target.server.name is the target name or *
   N is 0 for a perm kline, some value > 0 for a tkline

   user,host,reason should be obvious..
