There have been quite a few changes in Hybrid-7 from previous versions.
This document is an overview of what new features are included

AWAY is now propagated.  

The conf file format has been vastly improved.  The old conf format is 
no longer supported.  Many options that were defined at compile time are
now set in the config file.

Unauthorized connection notices have been moved to the +u user mode.

A new drone warning mode has been added... +e.  Setting +e will show the
gecos ("Real Name") field in a notice similar to the +c connection notice.

Server side ignore is included for all users.  Setting user mode +g will
make you ignore all private messages.  Channel messages are not affected.
People who you wish to communicate with can be permitted with the
/quote ACCEPT nick command.  The current accept list can be seen with
/quote ACCEPT *, and nicks can be removed with /quote ACCEPT -nick.
When a user tries to message you when you are set +g, and they are not
on the accept list, they will receive a message saying you are on server
side ignore.  You will also receive a message, but it is paced, so you will
only receive a notification every 60 seconds.  When a user changes his or 
her nick, he or she will be removed from any other user's ACCEPT list.  This
must be done in order to prevent other users from being able to trace another
user through NICK changes and the like.  When a user is placed on the ACCEPT
list, the user will be notified

Channels are also flood controlled.  Sending too many messages to a channel
when you are not opped or voiced will cause the server to block the flood 
after a certain amount of lines.  Opers can change the number of lines with 
/quote SET FLOODCOUNT.  The default is currently 8 lines.  A side effect
of this is that channel CTCP's will be throttled for non ops, but this cannot
be helped.

Half ops are included.  Setting a user +h in a channel will give them half-op
privileges.  Half ops can kick regular users but not full ops.

Channel Op Hiding is included as a channel mode.  By setting a channel +a, 
the ops are hidden to non-ops.  Once a user receives ops or halfops, they
will receive a set of server generated modes to synchronize their userlist.
This may be an inconvenience to some users, but it was decided to be the
best way to deal with the majority of clients.

Server hiding is also a conf file option.  With this option enabled, only 
opers can see what server a user is on.  TRACE are disabled for non-opers,
LINKS, WHO, WHOIS and the like are modified to not show a server.  Note that
this can break certain clients.

The old $*.server.mask and #*.host.mask no longer work.  The replacement is
$$*.server.mask and $#*.host.mask.  This change removes a long standing "bug"
in which a user can sit in a channel #*.fi and catch all messages directed
at #*.fi users.

The infamous VChans are included as well.  There can be multiple channels with
the same name, each has different "views" with different users.  When joining
a channel with vchans, a simple JOIN #channel will show a message saying 
which channels are available.  The user will then have to JOIN #channel !key
with one of the provided keys.  Creating a new vchan is easy as well.  Part 
the channel and do /quote CJOIN #channel.  A new view of the channel is 
created.  Currently, all users are able to issue CJOIN and create vchans.
Channel takeovers are now useless.  A legitimate op can just CJOIN a new 
vchan and get all of the old users over to the new vchan.  The takeover
people will then be sitting opped by themselves in a vchan while the original
users are back the way they were before in another vchan.  

CJOIN can be disabled for non-opers by setting vchans_oper_only=yes; in
the ircd.conf file.

Channels that have existed for at least 30 minutes are now preserved for 30
minutes if they are empty or split.  If a channel was +i before a split, it
will remain that way for 30 minutes.  All bans will still exist, preventing
abusers from joining through a ban on splits.  A user that does successfully
join an empty preserved channel will have ops.  If it was split at the time,
the timestamp protocol will remove the newer side's ops.  These preserved
channels replace the old NO_CHANOPS_ON_SPLIT and NO_JOIN_ON_SPLIT options.

Due to the new flood control for users, the multiple message restriction has
been removed. (/msg nick1,nick2,nick3 message)

Nearly all commands are now modules.  MODLIST will list all loaded modules, 
MODUNLOAD will remove a module from the ircd, and MODLOAD will load a new
module into the ircd.  MODRELOAD will unload then load the module in one
simple command.  All of these commands are documented in opers.txt and are 
restricted to admins only.

LazyLinks are now included.  These enable a leaf server to only need 
information about channels that it's local users are on, and nicks that have
been used (in a channel, in a private message, or in a WHO or WHOIS by a user
or channel on the leaf).  Read the LazyLinks.as.implemented.txt document for
more information.

STATS e now shows events.

STATS f now shows active file descriptors.

List of CAPAB's:
TS      - Support the TS protocol
QS      - Remove the QUIT storm on splits
EX      - Support +e exceptions in channels
CHW     - Support PRIVMSG/NOTICE @#channel messages
LL      - LazyLink server
IE      - Invite Exceptions - +I on channels - All nick!user@hosts listed in 
          a +I are exempt from having to be invited to the channel before 
          JOINing
VCHAN   - Support Virtual Channels
EOB     - End of Burst - Servers with this enabled cannot issue burst commands
          after it sends and receives an EOB command, thereby preventing op
          hacking
KLN     - Support remote K-lines
GLN     - Support G-lines
HOPS    - Support half-ops
HUB     - Is a hub server (used to prevent two LL hubs from linking in that 
          state)
AOPS    - Supports anonymous channel ops (channel mode +a)
UID     - Unique user-ID support

K-lines can now be sent to and accepted from other servers.  The shared {}
block in the conf file is used to specify which servers are trusted.

HUB is now a runtime option.  

Classes (Y: lines) can now have names instead of numbers.

Hybrid now supports IRCnet like redirection.  The redirserv and redirport 
options in an auth {} block will allow an admin to specify other servers 
to forward user connections to.  The client must support the 010 numeric
for this to work (EPIC supports it).  Note that there must always be a class
field in auth blocks, even ones that will just do redirection.

Local operators are no longer part of ircd.  The oper flags are used to 
restrict what each operator can do.

Autoconnects are far more customizable now.

A number of new options are in the general {} block of ircd.conf.  Look at
example.conf for more information

Remote K-lines are supported.  The shared block in the conf file is what
gives remote servers (and optionally restricted to specific user@host's)
permission to send their k-lines to your server.  Look at kline.txt for more 
details.  Below is a brief overview of the oper protocol to remote K-lines.

kline directed at a specific server
  /quote kline user@host ON server :reason
  /quote kline [time] user@host on server :reason

kline directed at all servers
  /quote kline user@host on * :reason
  /quote kline [time] user@host on * :reason

original normal local klines

  /quote kline user@host :reason
  /quote kline [time] user@host :reason

User modes can be specified oper only.  This is yet another start time
configurable option in ircd.conf.  See the comments in example.conf for
more details.

Hybrid now has the ISUPPORT/005 numeric now.  It can be seen when the client 
connects and in VERSION.  The fields are as follows:
KNOCK          - Support KNOCK
VCHANS         - Support Virtual Channels
MODES=%i       - The number of channel modes accepted per MODE command
MAXCHANNELS=%i - The compiled in maximum channels per user (Note that this
                 may become controlled in class {} in the future)
MAXBANS=%i     - The compiled in limit on the number of bans per channel
MAXTARGETS=%i  - The number of users that may be chained together in a 
                 PRIVMSG or NOTICE (user1,user2,user3...)
NICKLEN=%i     - The maximum nickname length
TOPICLEN=%i    - The compiled in topic length
KICKLEN=%i     - The length of a KICK message
CHANTYPES=%s   - The types of channels supported (currently '#&')
PREFIX=%s      - The allowed PRIVMSG/NOTICE channel prefixes (server based
                 /onotice, NOTICE @%#channel :message)

There are hooks in the code, that loadable modules can plug into.  These
hooks provide interfaces for user enhancement.  There are some hook modules
provided in contrib, providing WHOIS notice, STATS notice, and LINKS notice.
Others will be added as the ircd matures.

Usermode +l is provided in order to see LOCOPS
