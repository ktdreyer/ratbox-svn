     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   In an effort to reduce the damage caused to a network by a hacked O-line,
   Hybrid supports an OpenSSL based challenge-response system. This new
   system allows the admin to remove all oper block passwords from the conf
   file. Authentication is done through a public/private key.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                                  Requirements

   The ircd must be compiled with the --enable-openssl option to configure .
   If configure detects a working openssl library, --enable-openssl is
   implicitly enabled.

   oper {} blocks should not have normal passwords, but should contain the
   the name of the private key file. However it is possible for the user to
   use both challenge and normal passwords, but this would defeat the purpose
   of the challenge system.

   m_challenge.so must be loaded.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                                    Process

   Each oper should have a private key file and a public key file. The keys
   can be generated with the mkkeypair utility provided in tools/. The keys
   are compatible with cryptlink keys.

   The oper keeps their private key file in a safe place, and gives their
   public key file to their admin(s).

   The admin will place an entry for the public key file into a field called
   rsa_public_key_file of each oper's oper {} block in the conf file.

   The oper wishes to obtain their operator status, and issues the CHALLENGE
   command.

   The server will print out a long hexadecimal string, that needs to be fed
   to the respond utility provided in tools/rsa_respond.

   The respond program will generate an answer that is fed back to the
   CHALLENGE command.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                            Generating the Key Files

   The keys can be generated with the openssl command as follows:

       openssl genrsa -des3 -out rsa.key 1024
       openssl rsa -in rsa.key -pubout -out rsa.pub
   

   It is highly recommended that you set a password on your private key.

   A key pair can also be generated with the tools/mkkeypair utility.

   There is a tool called respond in tools/rsa_respond in the Hybrid source
   tree. This program can be easily distributed to each oper.

   A script is included in the Makefile to create a distributable tar file
   from the source tree. Issue make rsa_respond from the root of the source
   tree to create the rsa_respond.tar.gz archive. This can then be
   distributed to all of the server operators. Look at the README in the tar
   archive for more detailed instructions.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                          Using CHALLENGE and respond

   The administrator of the server you oper on should remove the password in
   your oper {} block and replace it with an entry for your public key, so
   that /oper will be disabled.

     Note: The public key is a VERY long string.

   The oper will issue /challenge oper_nick, and see something like below:

     Note: The challenge is all on one line.

     Note: With some clients, the oper will have to issue /quote CHALLENGE
     instead of /challenge.

   The oper will then have to feed that challenge to the respond program.

   | The respond utility's syntax is:                 |
   |                                                  |

   |   Note: The challenge parameter must be on one line.             |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------+

   The keyphase must be entered properly to get the response. The bottom line
   is the response that must be sent back to the server.

   The oper will issue the following command in order to obtain operator
   status:

   /challenge

     Note: The '+' is needed

   If successful, the oper will obtain operator status on the server.

   |------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | If the CHALLENGE fails, and you use ircii, EPIC, or BX, you may get    |
   | disconnected with the client asking for the server password. This is a |
   | client bug, not an ircd bug.                                           |

                                    Benefits

   The greatest benefit of using the challenge/response system is that there
   are no passwords sent over the network in plaintext. There are also no
   credentials left on the server side, as only public keys are kept in the
   conf. The use of public/private key encryption provides far greater
   security over having a single password, and may (if the key is kept
   secure, and has a good passphrase) virtually eliminate hacked O-lines.
