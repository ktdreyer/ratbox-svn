				RESV
			      -======-

- What is resv, and why was it coded?

  Resv is a method of 'juping' or 'reserving' nicks and channels, to prevent
  local clients using them.  It is commonly used to block channels which
  are home to abusers, and which attract DoS.  It can also be used to stop
  people pretending to be services, on a network that doesnt support them.

  It was coded to replace the method in hybrid-6 of blocking channels and
  nicks, and was implemented in a much cleaner way to make it faster.


- How can I create a resv?

  There are two types of resv.  'Permanent' and 'temporary'.  Temporary
  resv's will be erased when a server restarts (they will stay through a
  rehash).  Permanent resv's will stay through a restart.

  Permanent resv's are added into ircd.conf.  They should have the reason
  for the resv, followed by the nicks and channels being resv'd.  The
  following would block the channel #services, the nick 'services' and any
  nick ending in 'serv' (ie: chanserv)

  resv {
  	reason="There are no services on this network";
	channel="#services";
	nick="services";
	nick="*serv";
  };

  
  Temporary resv's can also block nicks, channels, and wildcard nicks.
  Although only an admin may create a resv with a wildcard in.

    Syntax:  /quote resv <#channel|nick> :<reason>

  So to resv #warez:
    /quote resv #warez :No warez on this network.


- How do I remove a resv?

  If the resv is permanent, then the resv must be removed from ircd.conf,
  then /rehash.

  If the resv is temporary, then use the unresv command:
    
    Syntax:  /quote unresv <#channel|nick>


- Can I make a resv on all servers?

  No.  In Hybrid resv's are local only.  If a channel is full of abusers,
  the solution is not to just block the channel, the abusers themselves
  should be removed through /kline and /dline.


- How do I list resv's?

  To list all current resv's:
    /stats q

  Which will give a reply like:
    q #warez No warez *@*
    Q services No services *@*

  If the first letter is a 'q', then the resv is temporary, if the first
  letter is a 'Q' then the resv is permanent (in ircd.conf).

  
- What does a client see if they try using a channel/nick that is resv'd?

  They see the numeric 437 (ERR_UNAVAILRESOURCE)

  Other networks (namely IRCNet) use this numeric on a split, to indicate
  the channel cannot be joined, as such it is recognised by a lot of
  clients.


- Can an oper see when someone tries to use a resv'd nick/channel?

  No.  When there is a valid reason for this, then possibly, but I honestly
  dont see why anyone needs it.


- Do you support wildcard channel resv's?

  No.  This is mainly for speed reasons.  When we are searching nicks, we
  cannot just check if the nick, and the item in the list of resv'd nicks
  are string equal, we have to check if they match, so we have to search a
  full list.  With channels however, we can search a hash table to see if an
  entry exists, if it doesnt, then the channel isnt resv'd.  We dont have to
  search through all the channels.

  Besides.. its legal for a channel to be called #*warez* anyway ;)
