 Known Bugs worthy of a mention:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Issues with server hostmasking.
    - If for example the new servername is blah.blah.blah.nl, the following 
      servernames will be checked, in this order: *.blah.blah.nl, *.blah.nl,
      *.nl, one of which will match the host-masked server they are
      connecting behind. This will be accepted by the host-masked server it
      is connected behind, but when it reaches the server the host-masked
      server is connected to, the find_server will match, so the host-masked
      server will be dropped.

2.  Unconfirmed reports of /modunload coring on certain platforms.
    - There is an issue here with unloading a different module to that what
      is loaded.  For example, you have m_vanity.so as a loaded module, and
      you add 4 new commands to it, replace the module, then try to unload it.
      
      If you have made the module correctly, when unloading the module, you
      would have also coded it to remove the 4 new commands, which it cant do
      as they dont exist.  This could cause the server to core.  It also cannot
      realistically be fixed, as you remove the whole point of dynamic modules.

      This could also happen if you have a modules { path="x"; }; statement in
      your config, with an old, or different copy of the module in.  It may
      try to unload this version of the module, instead of the one that is 
      actually loaded.

      So:
      - Minor changes are normally ok, such as adding a couple of lines to code.
      If you do a major change to the module, including adding new commands, it
      is recommended that you unload the module FIRST, replace the module file
      and then /modload the module.
      - Dont have multiple copies of the same module in your paths.

3.  Problem with msgfmt command building custom msgs using gettext
    - Please ensure you are using GNU gettext version 0.10.35.
      Other versions are untested, and some are known to be
      incompatible.

4.  When linking servers, you may see warnings about servers being sent
    403 numerics.  This is caused by the NOTICE AUTH :*** ... messages,
    and is normal.

5.  Admins receiving multiple notices
    - Due to the fact we try to hide a servers real IP, we send some 
      notices that have an IP address in them twice.  We send one to
      the admins with the real IP in, and one to all opers (admins inc.)
      with the servername instead.
