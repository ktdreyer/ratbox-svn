 Known Bugs worthy of a mention:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Issues with vchans.  
    - Although vchans do work 'perfectly' in this release, there are a number of
      issues which may 'break' them, due to attempts to make them backwards 
      compatable, the most notable being the ability to join ##channel_123
      which is thought to be a vchan of #channel by other servers

2.  Issues with server hostmasking.
    - If for example the new servername is blah.blah.blah.nl, the following 
      servernames will be checked, in this order: *.blah.blah.nl, *.blah.nl, *.nl,
      one of which will match the host-masked server they are connecting behind. 
      This will be accepted by the host-masked server it is connected behind, 
      but when it reaches the server the host-masked server is connected to, 
      the find_server will match, so the host-masked server will be dropped.

3.  Issue with the HUB variable which can be changed at runtime.
    - If you are a lazyleaf server, please dont change hub=yes; at runtime - 
      this breaks stuff :)

4.  Unconfirmed reports of /modunload coring on certain platforms.
    - We think we have caught most of them, please let us know if you get a 
      problem.

5.  opers@server and user@server PRIVMSG/NOTICE broken
    - eg PRIVMSG opers@irc.monkie.org :test
      PRIVMSG stats@stats.monkie.org :help 
      - to be fixed in beta2

6.  Problem with msgfmt command building custom msgs using gettext
    - Please ensure you are using GNU gettext version 0.10.35.
      Other versions are untested, and some are known to be
      incompatable.
