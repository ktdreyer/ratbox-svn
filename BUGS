 Known Bugs worthy of a mention:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Issues with vchans.  
    - Although vchans do work 'perfectly' in this release, there are a number of
      issues which may 'break' them, due to attempts to make them backwards 
      compatable, the most notable being the ability to join ##channel_123
      which is thought to be a vchan of #channel by other servers

2.  Issues with server hostmasking.
    - If for example the new servername is blah.blah.blah.nl, the following 
      servernames will be checked, in this order: *.blah.blah.nl, *.blah.nl, *.nl,
      one of which will match the host-masked server they are connecting behind. 
      This will be accepted by the host-masked server it is connected behind, 
      but when it reaches the server the host-masked server is connected to, 
      the find_server will match, so the host-masked server will be dropped.

3.  Issue with the HUB variable which can be changed at runtime.
    - If you are a lazyleaf server, please dont change hub=yes; at runtime - 
      this breaks stuff :)

4.  Unconfirmed reports of /modunload coring on certain platforms.
    - We think we have caught most of them, please let us know if you get a 
      problem.

5.  opers@server and user@server PRIVMSG/NOTICE broken
    - eg PRIVMSG opers@irc.monkie.org :test
      PRIVMSG stats@stats.monkie.org :help 
      - to be fixed in beta2

6.  Problem with msgfmt command building custom msgs using gettext
    - Please ensure you are using GNU gettext version 0.10.35.
      Other versions are untested, and some are known to be
      incompatable.

7.  When linking servers, you may see warnings about servers being sent
    403 numerics.  This is caused by the NOTICE AUTH :*** ... messages,
    and is normal.
