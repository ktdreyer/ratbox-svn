 Known Bugs worthy of a mention:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
1.  Issues with server hostmasking.
    - If for example the new servername is blah.blah.blah.nl, the following
      servernames will be checked, in this order: *.blah.blah.nl, *.blah.nl,
      *.nl, one of which will match the host-masked server they are
      connecting behind. This will be accepted by the host-masked server it
      is connected behind, but when it reaches the server the host-masked
      server is connected to, the find_server will match, so the host-masked
      server will be dropped.
      --> This corrected?

2.  /MODUNLOAD causes cores:
    - If a module is modified before being unloaded, /MODUNLOAD (and
      therefore /MODRELOAD) may cause a core.

      This problem is caused by the behaviour of the OS, which treats
      shared libraries differently to executables (modifying the ircd
      binary whilst it is running would also cause a core, but is denied
      by the OS).  There is no way to fix this at the application level,
      and fixing the OS to do the right thing is also difficult.

      A workaround to avoid coring is possible however.  To install new
      modules, first remove or rename the old module, then copy/move the
      new file into place.  /MODUNLOAD will then work successfully.

      Alternatively, running ./configure with the --disable-shared-modules
      argument will link all the commands statically, losing the advantages
      of upgrading at runtime, but reducing the chances of accidentally
      coring your server.

BUG REPORTS: If you run this code and encounter problems, you must report
 the bug in by E-MAIL to ircd-ratbox@lists.ratbox.org

 Please include a gdb backtrace and keep your binaries, modules and core file
 in case the developers need more information.
