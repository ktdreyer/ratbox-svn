Known Bugs worthy of a mention:
-------------------------------

1.  Issues with vchans.  
    - Although vchans do work 'perfectly' in this release,
      there are a number of issues which may 'break' them,
      due to attempts to make them backwards compatable,
      the most notable being the ability to join ##channel_123
      which is thought to be a vchan of #channel by other servers

2.  Issues with server hostmasking.
    - If for example the new servername is blah.blah.blah.nl, the
      following servernames will be checked, in this order:   
      *.blah.blah.nl, *.blah.nl, *.nl, one of which will match the
      host-masked server they are connecting behind. This will be
      accepted by the host-masked server it is connected behind, 
      but when it reaches the server the host-masked server is
      connected to, the find_server will match, so the host-masked
      server will be dropped.

3.  Issue with the HUB variable which can be changed at runtime.
    - If you are a lazyleaf server, please dont change hub=yes;
      at runtime - this breaks stuff :)

4.  Unconfirmed reports of /modunload coring on certain platforms.
    - We think we have caught most of them, please let us know
      if you get a problem.

5.  opers@server and user@server PRIVMSG/NOTICE broken
    - eg PRIVMSG opers@irc.monkie.org :test
      PRIVMSG stats@stats.monkie.org :help
      - to be fixed in beta2

6.  Problem with msgfmt command building custom msgs using gettext
