******************************* IMPORTANT *************************************

  *********** Note for those who dont bother reading docs *****************
  * Reading INSTALL is now a must, as the old DPATH is now specified when *
  * configure is run.                                                     *
  * - You now need to ./configure --prefix="/path/to/install/it"          *
  * The old config format WILL NOT WORK.  Please see doc/example.conf (!) *
  *									  *
  * The old kline format WILL NOT WORK.  Please use convertklines which   *
  * will be installed with your ircd!					  *

******************************* REQUIREMENTS **********************************

Necessary Requirements:

- A supported platform (look below)

- A working dynamic load library, unless
  compiling as static, without module
  support.

- A working lex.  Solaris /usr/ccs/bin/lex
  appears to be broken, on this system flex
  should be used.

- A working bison or byacc.  FreeBSD and BSD/OS
  byacc are currently broken, and will dump core
  when building the ircd_parser.y.

Feature Specific Requirements:

- For the SSL Challenge controlled OPER feature and encrypted server links,
  a working OpenSSL library

- For dynamic message locale support, a working gettext (intl) library

- For encrypted oper and (optional) server passwords, a working DES and/or
  MD5 library

*******************************************************************************

- To report bugs in hybrid, send the bug report to ircd-hybrid@the-project.org

- Known bugs are listed in the BUGS file

- See the INSTALL document for info on configuring and compiling
  ircd-hybrid.

- Please read doc/index.txt to get an overview of the current documentation.

- Old Hybrid 5/6 configuration files are no longer supported.  All conf
  files will have to be converted to the Hybrid 7 format.  A convertconf
  utility is provided and installed into bin/.

- If you are wondering why config.h is practically empty, its because many 
  things that were once in config.h are now specified in the 'general'
  block of ircd.conf.  Look at example.conf for more information about
  these options.

- There is now a mailing list for general discussion of Hybrid.  To subscribe
  to the Hybrid List, send email to listmanager@the-project.org with
  the subject "subscribe hybrid".

- If you run in to a problem you think may be specific to your platform,
  check README.PLATFORMS for some hints.

- SOLARIS USERS: this code appears to tickle a bug in older gcc and 
  egcs ONLY on 64-bit Solaris7.  gcc-2.95 and SunPro C on 64bit should
  work fine, and any gcc or SunPro compiled on 32bit.

- GCC USERS ON SPARC AND ULTRASPARC: what seems to be a bug in gcc will
  cause code built with gcc on sparc and ultrasparc systems up to at least
  2.95.3 to fall flat on its face in at least one known location 
  reproducably. If it is possible, you should build with SunPro or check
  to see if the bug exists with newer GCC. We will make a note when GCC
  has been fixed for this problem when we become aware of a fix.

- DARWIN USERS: Darwin 1.3.7 (Mac OS X before 10.1) will not be able to
  run with shared modules in the forseeable future, but it does run fine
  with --disable-shared-modules passed to configure. Later versions of
  Darwin starting at least with those shipping with Mac OS X 10.1 will
  build hybrid with working shared modules out of the box.

- SUPPORTED PLATFORMS: this code should compile without any warnings
  on FreeBSD 3.x/4.x, RedHat 6.2, Debian Potato and Solaris 7/8 sparc.  
  Please let us know if you find otherwise.  
  It probably does not compile on AIX, IRIX or libc5 Linux.

- TESTED PLATFORMS:  The code has been tested on the following platforms, and
  is known to run properly.
  FreeBSD 3.x/4.x
  Linux glibc
  Solaris 2.6/7/8
  OpenBSD 2.8
  NetBSD 1.4

- CYGWIN USERS: Unfortunately, cygwin support has been removed

- Please read doc/whats-new.txt for information about what is in this release

- Other files recommended for reading: BUGS, INSTALL
