 NOT recommend that you run BETA code on production IRC networks such
 as EFnet.

BUGS: Major bugs in this release are listed in BUGS and at 
 http://bugs.efnow.net

BUG REPORTS: If you run this code and encounter problems, you must report
 the bug in one of the following ways:

  b) By EMAIL to ircd-hybrid@the-project.org.  
  c) By GNATS - use the `send-pr' script that should be installed into bin/ 
     along with the rest of ircd.

DISCUSSION: there is a mailing list for discussion of hybrid issues,
 including betas.  To subscribe, send a message with the subject "subscribe"
 to hybrid-request@the-project.org.  This is the proper place to discuss new
