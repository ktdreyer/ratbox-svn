  *********** Note for those who dont bother reading docs *****************    
  * - Reading INSTALL is now a must, as the old DPATH is now specified    *
  *   when configure is run.                                              *
  *   You now need to ./configure --prefix="/path/to/install/it"          *
  * - The old config format WILL NOT WORK.  Please see doc/example.conf!  *
  * - If you get errors compiling custom.mo, ensure you are using the     *
  *   latest available gettext.  Tested with GNU gettext 0.10.35          *
