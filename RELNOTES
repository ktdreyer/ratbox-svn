This is the current release version of the 'stable' tree of ircd-ratbox.

doc/whats-new.txt contains important lists of changes between 2.0 and 1.5 -
it is important you read this file before upgrading.

-- ircd-ratbox-2.0.6
- tack the kline/gline/xline a user matches onto the end of the exempt
  notice
- fix misleading xline documentation on spaces
- fix the +k-k bug in channels
- added new operator {}; flag, "remoteban", controls whether oper can
  issue remote klines etc
- added the negation of flags, via ~flag.  Default oper flags modified to be
  operwall and remoteban.
- propagate upto MAXMODEPARAMSSERV (10) modes in one go, rather than
  splitting it up into 4,4,2
- rework buffer length tracking when building outbound mode buffers.
- added 'Z' to umodes in 002
- tack our SID onto the end of RPL_VERSION
- remove encrypted=yes|no; from auth {}; and operator {};, its now in flags
  in both.  Defaults to off for auth {}, on for operator {} which requires
  the negation of ~encrypted to disable it.
- properly close opers helpfile dir
- add unreject, to remove one ip from the reject cache
- fix klines/glines against user@1.2.3.* etc.
- properly substitute logdir into the Makefile so its created on make
  install
- speed up unkline for perm klines, its still slow as hell, but less so
- dont change the ts of a client whos nick flooding, or one changing case of
  nick
- added "Failed to deliver: [%.20s]" to the ERR_NOSUCHNICK we send out
  when relaying a PRIVMSG to a UID
- fix ungline
- keep the two fields sent in USER
- added etrace -v4, etrace -v6 and etrace -full.  First two list ipv4/ipv6,
  latter gives the two fields sent in USER, via numeric 708 (RPL_ETRACEFULL)
- Expire temp r/x lines around every 60 seconds instead of every 5 minutes

-- ircd-ratbox-2.0.5
- reenable oneshot, really fix the IO errors.

-- ircd-ratbox-2.0.4
- fix a core when an oper did /quote uid
- revert kqueue code to that from 1.x 
- allow remote xlines that match existing xlines to propagate
- fix an adns compile error
- allow local opers to squit local servers
- new config option in general {}; default_invisible = yes|no; default no.
  controls whether users are made +i by default on connect
- move stats A to RPL_STATSDEBUG, removing RPL_STATSALINE
- fix a memory leak in the auth code
- disable oneshot with kqueue, it appears to fix the IO errors

-- ircd-ratbox-2.0.3
- disable '"' as a valid char in xline/resv reasons 
- disable "\"," in an xline - it makes it unparsable
- add translation of \s in an xline to a space
- invite_ops_only = yes|no; default yes
  controls whether unopped users may issue invites to a -i channel
- default reject cache to on
- various unkline related cleanups
- tweak memory allocation sizes for large networks, this increases
  startup memory by quite a bit, so unless you are on a 5000+ user
  network pass --enable-small-net
- merge upstream version of adns
- fix another possible double exit of clients
- new format of RPL_LOCALUSERS and RPL_GLOBALUSERS (265/266) which makes
  them parsable, in coordination with ircnet:
  :%s 265 %s %d %d :Current local users %d, max %d
 
-- ircd-ratbox-2.0.2
- fix a possible overflow with SJOIN when converting nicks -> ids
- new flags in shared {};, tkline, txline and tresv, allowing temp only of
  kline, xline and resv respectively.
- new flags in cluster {}; tkline, txline and tresv which will cluster
  only the temp of each type.  kline, xline and resv will now *only*
  cluster the permanent ones of each type.
- enforce top-down ordering of shared {}; blocks.  The first one that
  matches on server and user@host will be used.  The users access will then
  depend on that shared blocks privs and we will NOT fallback to another
  that matches and has the right privs.
- cluster {}; no longer allows remote opers to apply remote klines etc, it
  simply dictates who we send our bans to.  To allow remote servers to
  cluster to a server it must have its own shared {}; block.
- fix possible server exists issue whilst waiting for connect callback
- exempt users messaging themselves from +g
- fix a core with removing accepts
- fix connect {}; to refcount classes properly
- memleak fixes with operator {}; passwords, conf parser and dns code
- fix some padding issues with ipv6
- added umode +C, an extended version of +c thats machine parsable and gives
  the two other fields given in the USER command
- add some debugging code to help track down a problem with the abort_list
- fix a problem with --with-nicklen in configure

-- ircd-ratbox-2.0.1
- fix sending UIDs out on modes for voiced users
- fix a core with the patricia and ipv4 builds

  - dynamically allocate channel name

  - build defaulted to ipv4, ip storage cleanups

-- ircd-ratbox-2.0.0
- fix another memleak with capab
- fix a core when exiting an unknown client and generating an io error
- check for auth {}; not having any valid user@host's, so we dont add an
  empty ConfItem to lists
- make servermodes come from actual server, not local server
- new conf option to general {};, disable_fake_channels which disallows
  creation/joining of channels with bold, underline, reverse, mirc colour
  and hard space.  Note, this may impact some non-english charsets.
- fix location of pid path back to etc/
