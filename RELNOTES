-- ircd-ratbox-2.0rc3
- dont allow external messages to a +m channel
- fix an IO error with rejected clients
- match() speedup for special case of "*"
- remove some debug asserts that are quite evil
- fix propagation of TS6 JOIN on +k channels
- DEFAULT_SENDQ is now 20mb
- default sendq_eob is now 0 rather than DEFAULT_SENDQ, so itll just fall
  back to class sendq if its not set.
- EOB command is gone, now always emulated over PING/PONG, fixing a
  bug with sendq_eob
- fix SID leak in PONG
- fix invalid error string in "Error connecting to.." notice on timeout
- fix a memory leak with local clients
- add sendq_eob to stats Y
- fix the reject cache list ordering
- quick and simple channel list searches on min/max users: LIST <n,>m
- misplaced ':' in stats T
- remove bogus assert in free_conf()

-- ircd-ratbox-2.0rc2
- only attempt to propagate modes if we actually need to
- updated convertilines to take account of new conf format
- ilog() now properly handles an error during writing
- rehash/SIGHUP now close/reopen logfiles
- reject list is now ordered by time, for efficiency
- fix the time_t formatting stuff, now always uses %ld, casted to (long)
- fix remote klines that werent accepted causing a rehash
- fix no libz and compression check in parser
- we were (wrongly) showing 'E' in stats C if a servers password is
  crypt()ed
- added an (unused) type field to xlines over ENCAP, for compatibility with
  other ircds which have it.  Temporary xlines, or xlines sent over a hyb6
  hub will NOT work between between 2.0rc2 and earlier versions anymore.
- implemented operspy stuff, same as 1.x
- added m_testmask.c, given a user@host mask, gives anonymous stats on how
  many local/remote clients match the mask:
  <- :stable.lan 724 anfl *@*.goat 1 0 :Local/remote clients match
- fixed problems when removing modes due to an SJOIN/JOIN if MAXMODEPARAMS
  wasnt 4
- fix a buffer overflow when removing bans
- ignore ERR_NOSUCHSERVER directed at us, happens naturally now.
- removed warning when clock runs backwards, happens naturally from ntp
- first param of RPL_STATSXLINE is now the amount of times that xline has
  been used to reject a client
- "SAFELIST" added to 005
- rewrote testline to be somewhat more useful
- added testgecos to test a gecos against xlines
- fix a core on an external privmsg to a -n channel
- check for empty sjoins more thoroughly

-- ircd-ratbox-2.0rc1

- add a quick netwide EOB via PING/PONG
- add challenge.pl, for irssi
- fixed LOCOPS to go over ENCAP when no CAP_CLUSTER is available

  everyone or noone.

- fix possible core in rejectcache when walking the patricia
- ClearOper() was setting clients to have local handlers
- fix a buffer overflow in MODE
- fix a nick delay core
- unglines are now logged in a consistent format with glines
- balloc now memset()'s on alloc
- locops propagation was missing a ':'
- convertconf is gone
- default compression_level is now 4
- fixed remote ban logic, which caused a desync
- always use "0::1" etc instead of "::1" in sockhost, as it breaks TS6.

-- ircd-ratbox-2.0b5

  {}; - replaced with flags = compressed, encrypted, topicburst, autoconn;

- fix servlink overstepping bounds of array
- fixed global capabs to not lose capabilities we dont ourselves support
- fixed ERR_NOSUCHNICK/ERR_NOSUCHSERVER to not leak UIDs
